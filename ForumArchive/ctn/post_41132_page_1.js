So I resize it to fit the vehicle_co_ and make all other parts children of it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOn load in BJS_co_ I set the cube_t_s visibility to false_co_ set a BoxImpostor on it_co_ and everything look fine_dd_ the vehicle is visible and stays successfully on the ground.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe problem is when pressing the directional controls to make the wheels rotate_co_ they become squeezed (they are no more _qt_round_qt_ (oval section instead of circular section)).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI noticed that when the wheel are squeezed (when they are set a rotation value along any axis)_co_ their bounding box actually get the shape of the vehicle bounding box (which is the parent of every meshes)._lt_br /_gt_\n\tConsequently_co_ when I create a cubic instead of a cuboid vehicle bounding box in Blender (the surplus volume being put above the vehicle)_co_ the wheels behave as expected and run smoothly (but the vehicle bounding box is far too big!)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDoes anyone know what is happening?
