It’d be nice to be able to do a deep require like require(_t_babylonjs/extensions/materialsLibrary/water_t_). And putting the .fx files in there would probably make sense. I would have to figure out how to get my webpack setup to work with shaders_co_ yet to do that. But if the files could at least be in the npm package so that I can access them at all_co_ it would make my webpack project much easier.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThoughts?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-02-07T16:48:04Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tI see no problem.
