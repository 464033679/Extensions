I am developing an online multiplayer game on it and while testing I have encountered a strange problem._lt_br /_gt_\n\tSo I have this simple terrain and a mesh which moves on a pick event. I have integrated Babylon-navmash extension and so far it has been working great. What seems a little strange to me is that sometimes the mesh disappears from the screen ( in movement ) only to reappear again some frames later. In other cases it stops while being invisible. When I have a camera with it as a target_co_ the camera itself shows a blue screen when the mesh disappears._lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tI think probably its a render problem. I am not sure though. Any thoughts _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ ? Since the camera loses the target after it disappears I don_t_t think its camera related but...again_co_ I am not sure._lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tOn a further note_co_ I am not using physics neither collisions just some ray picking. And I am also using a shadow map with a texture of 512 size. I am rendering only the shadows of this mesh_co_ for the static ones most surely I will bake the shadow maps._lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tThanks again for this awesome tool!_lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tBest Regards_co__lt_br /_gt_\n\tRelative Null.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-09-27T15:31:33Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHello and thanks a lot for the kind words!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt is complex to help you without a repro case unfortunately.
