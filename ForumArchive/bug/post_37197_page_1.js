I ran into a problem recently when trying to serialize environmentTexture. It just crashes the scene and most times does not give any error message.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI tried to take a look a the engine codebase but cant seem to find any STATIC SCENE PARSE that I would assume has some _qt_parsedScene_qt_ javascript object but it does not.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDoes anyone know WHY I cant serialize environmentTexture or WHERE I would go add that support to the engine.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNote_dd_ When using the toolkit to export scenes that have an environmentTexture it would be MUCH BETTER to be able to serialize that texture in the babylon json just like any other\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tproperty. Otherwise_co_ you will ALWAYS have to DEPEND on the Babylon Toolkit_t_s Scene Manager API to render your main environment texture. For those that are planning to use PURE EXPORT ONLY features will be out of luck. So I am hoping to get this resolved by the next release. Any info is ALWAYS appreciated.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_u_gt__lt_strong_gt_UPDATED _lt_span_gt__dd_ _lt_/span_gt__lt_/strong_gt__lt_/u_gt__lt_span_gt_ I updaed 3.2 to fix the problem and also added BABYLON.HDRCubeTexture as a type of scene.environmentTexture that can be serialized into the scene file._lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Sebavan","Date":"2018-04-23T22:39:31Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can add it here_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Tools/babylon.sceneSerializer.ts#L116_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Tools/babylon.sceneSerializer.ts#L116_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
