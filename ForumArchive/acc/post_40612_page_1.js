I’ve been creating a map in blender. Exporting to the babylon format and then using BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh to load it.

I found there were a few shapes that worked with BoxImpostor instead of MeshImpostor. So I copy/pasted those to generate a few walls in order to make a starter map. Now I’d like to make a proper map with windows etc. So I need to understand what’s going wrong.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI’ve been looking around for what seems like ages with no luck. Any help would be extremely appreciated.
