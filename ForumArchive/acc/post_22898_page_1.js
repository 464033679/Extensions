I know this from working with Autodesk and Kaydara before that. This is why Kaydara went on a mission to make the ASCII FBX format a standard for most every CGI application_co_ and succeeded. And this has been maintained since Autodesk aquired Filmbox (MotionBuilder) in 2006.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo especially if you are using 3dsMax_co_ then the ASCII FBX format will support almost every aspect in your scene including al morph targets and skinned rigs - down to the smallest detail. THere are some preparations that you need to make - such as setting a _qt_default_qt_ shape key at from 0 or frame 1 before setting any of your morph targets_co_ but this an a few other steps depending on your scene are necessary to create compatability between applications which are vastly different in how they process IK_co_ morph targets_co_ surfaces_co_ etc. And every Autodesk application supports binary FBX files_co_ and many other applications do also. So you can keep all of your files in binary format_co_ until you run into a problem_co_ then simply use the free FBX converter to convert to ASCII.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is the only pipeline I_t_ve discovered which is virtually flawless_co_ and supports every key aspect of your scene between most applications. and can tell you (and I_t_m guessing _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt_ might agree)_co_ writing your own converter is ALLOT of work maintaining full versioning compatability_sm_ especially when there is a fully supportive and reliable solution.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf you run into any problems or have any questions concerning the workflow or any considerations_co_ please ask.

I thought Collada was going to be a Godsend when it was released years ago_co_ spent my $500 to purchase it_co_ and it was virtually useless with uncountable bugs from the very beginning.
