When I print positions of these meshes_co_ it says they are all at 0_co_0_co_0. However_co_ when I try to rotate or change position it behaves like its pivot position is at 0_co_0_co_0 and their object position is at another point. So_co_  I_t_m having trouble when i try to move and rotate the weapon meshes around the tower model.  I have tried to set bounding box_t_s center point as pivot point of the object_co_ but it did not work. Still when i try to rotate weapons_co_ it rotates around another axis.
