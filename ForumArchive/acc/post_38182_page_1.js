I was wondering why/how to prevent it from happening.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNote_dd_ I suspected that it is because they load too close to the ground and bounce because the computer erroneously thinks that the meshes/ground are touching. I am able to lessen the jump by making the ground’s position.y _eq_ -0.5 (so it is even clearer to the computer that the objects are not touching because all objects right now load at position.y _eq_ 0 (and I move objects before the next object loads so they don_t_t intersect and start a collision))_co_ but the jump still occurs_co_ just less of a jump and still noticeable.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tProblem 2_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAfter loading a certain scene_co_ after being loaded_co_ each instance of a special object I created (a class I created that includes a mesh) jumps in opposite directions from each other. I’m not sure why. I have a feeling it has to do with having multiple instances of the same class_co_ each with their own mesh.
