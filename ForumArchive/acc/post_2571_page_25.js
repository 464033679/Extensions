GIT is probably great for those who need to see those things.  I don_t_t.  I don_t_t care about those things.  I care that the words used in tutorials... are simple... clear... translatable.  I care about documents getting too big_co_ and about granularity_co_ and about delivering a great help document when folks need help.... and having easy urls to get to those help documents.  (The new BD has some of these things... and that_t_s great!) _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I care about broken urls in the docs and on the forum.  I care about things in BJS that are not yet documented.  I care about shoving the world_t_s best webGL framework... up the nostrils and butts of as many folks as possible... and to make it feel fun.  I care about getting answers to forum questions... as fast as possible... and as detailed as possible.  I have written many tutorial-like things on the forum.... heavily fleshed because... they will be used as tutorials by future users... and help reduce forum load._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I don_t_t care about version management... not even a little.  I hope the best of luck for those who DO manage versions... and I_t_m glad they now have the tools they need to do that better... but I just fix/create docs.   I didn_t_t sign-up for version control officer.  hehe.  So you see_co_ just give me an ftp folder somewhere... and I_t_ll stuff crap in it from time to time.  Then the version managers can play with their little commune tools on my folder... all they want.  I won_t_t get in their way_co_ I promise.  They need to stay out of MY way_co_ and I_t_ll gladly stay out of their way. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Simple_dd_  Here_t_s my proposed changes... in this ftp directory.  Here_t_s a .txt file with a 400 page synapse of WHY I think these changes need to be made_co_ and I can show you the exact line numbers of the changes... and tell you a paragraph about EACH change... and the phonetic philosophies behind any change of wordings and terminology used.  We can have long discussions in my proposal files... about ontologies.  I can tell you HOW my heavy use of ellipses... cause a document to have a _qt_cadence_qt_... song-like... poem-like... which helps people remember the information.  What else does the validator want to know about these proposed changes?  I can offer far more information about my edit reasoning... than a simple single-line _qt_About this edit_qt_ comment._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But DK or other curators would see my big edit explanation_co_ and think _qt_yikes_co_ that_t_s a crapload of English_qt_ and just validate the change instead of knowing my reasoning behind it.  They have no time to learn Wingnut documenting philosophies.  The world is in a hurry.  In my quest to be highly-detailed_co_ I just bog the system with the long talkings... like right now._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Anyway_co_ these are the things I care about.  Yet I walk carefully_co_ because I_t_m newbie.  And I suggest things to BD dev team... that often aren_t_t plausible or possible.... because I_t_m a dreamer.  I have visions. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I play violin sometimes.  The violin is designed in a way that your fingers automatically land in the right places on the neck... due to proper neck scaling.  That is why children_t_s violins are 1/2 scale_co_ teens are 3/4 scale_co_ and adults 4/4 scale.  We don_t_t want to stretch the fingers... no matter what the size of the hand.  We want the fingers to naturally land in the right places... all the time.  This is what I care about for BJS.  Intuitive.  I want to make BJS teach itself... possibly with the help of curiosity. I want user_t_s fingers to land in the right places on the BJS violin neck_co_ no matter what the experience levels (the hand size) of the user.  How_t_s that for a dream?  But it doesn_t_t use version management at all!  That_t_s not my world.  That_t_s not what I do._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I used to be a HUGE fan of RDF.  Anyone know what that is?  It_t_s the ultimate in metadata.  But_co_ it_t_s XML... so it won_t_t be found _t_round these parts.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_  Thanks for the comments._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2015-08-13T15:05:43Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hi communauty_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I hope my English will be not too bad.
