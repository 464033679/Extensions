I made a Visual Studio Solution that _qt_builds_qt_ your own babylonJS file (myBabylon.js instead of babylon.1.8.0.js) and use it in a MVC application. That_t_s useful if you don_t_t want to deal with javascript dependencies or you don_t_t remember which files you modified. You can also add your own files to babylonJS._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Moreover_co_ no need to use the all package if you don_t_t need the MVC application. You can separetely _qt_build_qt_ your myBabylon.js file thanks to _qt_myBabylonJS/executables/mybabylonjs.bat_qt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_More about it here_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/125_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/125_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
