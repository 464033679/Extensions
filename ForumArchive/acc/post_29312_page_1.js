The meshes seem to be in the correct place in space but when panning around it seems that order that the transparent objects are rendered is backwards -- the transparent texture which should be rendered first is rendered last (that is_co_ the one in the front is behind and the one in the back is in front).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t find a lot of documentation of how to update the depth buffer for alpha texture rendering.
