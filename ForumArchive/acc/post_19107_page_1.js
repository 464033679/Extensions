I personally use Motionbuilder for all of my animation as well as blending motions to quickly build my move trees. And I_t_m a huge fan of the FBX file format_co_ as I worked with Kaydara to build this format originally - so I find the ascii version quite easy to work with - as well as this format supports ALL aspects of practically any 3D scene exported from most 3D applications. But keep in mind that Blender only imports and exports the binary FBX format_co_ but you can either use Motionbuilder to write or convert ascii to binary and binary to ascii - or you can use the free FBX viewer which is a great tool to work with FBX files in real time. But you only require the ascii version of the FBX format if you want to easily edit scenes written in a text format - which I find I can quickly make changes that aren_t_t available to me in other file formats. And if you have a Kinect_co_ you are able to capture your motion in real-time directly into Motionbuilder_sm_ creating animations quickly_co_ with all of the tools necessary to blend and create move trees._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Motionbuilder also characterizes and retargets animations of skeletons in seconds_co_ and handles props as quickly as well - including every tool you might ever want to use for all of your character retargetting_co_ animation_co_ motion capture_co_ textures_co_ lights_co_ cameras_co_ etc. If you are able to use MB_co_ you_t_ll require no other software other than Blender or a modeling software. It is also great to animate and integrate all other object animation quickly._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But as budget is usually an issue_co_ Motionbuilder is not a freeware application - however you can use the trial for 30 days for free to decide if it works for your purposes - and if you meet the requirements_co_ the student version is only a few hundred dollars to purchase a fully functioning license._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Also_co_ I_t_m not certain if Blender is capable of binding multiple meshes to a single skeleton_co_ but Maya certainly does this and would would assume Blender does this also - and you can then use _lt_em_gt_mesh.isVisible _lt_/em_gt_to hide and unhide your character meshes in babylon - keeping in mind your vertex count limits for both desktops and mobile devices._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"gryff","Date":"2015-12-14T07:46:31Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt__gt__lt_div_gt_it must be a valid solution and works entirely in Blender_lt_/div_gt__lt_/blockquote_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Actually MakeHuman exports _dd_ .fbx_co_ .dae_co_ .stl_co_ as well as for Ogre3D and .obj (not sure about the rigs for some of them).
