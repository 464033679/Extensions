However merging meshes means one material. For example merging the trunk and leaves on your tree would mean the they would both have to be the same colour. Also you could not have a character colliding with one tree.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHave you looked at the _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/overviews/solid_particle_system_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_solid particle system_lt_/a_gt_? You could make a forest from the trunks and branches (as separate solid particles) with their own colours and the forest would be one mesh. By making the forest mesh immutable then there is only one draw call. However if you wish a character to collide with a tree then it is possible but memory and CPU time is increased.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"TomaszFurca","Date":"2017-06-24T19:53:45Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSPS is great tool_co_ but i want prepare scene i blender_co_ so i can_t_t use SPS.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAll in one video\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsEmbeddedVideo_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div_gt_\n\t\t_lt_iframe allowfullscreen_eq__qt_true_qt_ frameborder_eq__qt_0_qt_ height_eq__qt_270_qt_ src_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.youtube.com/embed/MLdj6DwVETM?feature_eq_oembed_qt_ width_eq__qt_480_qt__gt__lt_/iframe_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/div_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2017-06-26T16:41:04Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhy do you not use Blender &amp_sm_ the exporter to optimize?  I did not have time to watch your video_co_ but have put many things in exporter to transfer things already optimized.  Running through checklists for optimization_co_ rather than developing for optimization_co_ just seems like turd polishing to me.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor all your background meshes_co_ check _t_Freeze World Matrix_t_.  Saves computing a world matrix for a mesh every frame when it never moves / rotates / or scales differently.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can also check _t_check ready only once_t_ for unique materials.  Be ready to uncheck if this causes side effects.  Tower of Babel generates fairly friendly code to get around this though.  Every time you instance a mesh_co_ the materials are marked as unready.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor using BABYLON.InstancedMesh_co_ you can establish this in Blender.  Blender also has tools like Joining and Limited Dissolve.  For these you may want to do them at the end of dev &amp_sm_ increment your .blend file to save both ways.  Always delimit by UV when using Limited Dissolve on a mesh with textures.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
