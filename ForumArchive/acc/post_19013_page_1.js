That_t_s truly something._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Now_co_ if I can only get Wikipedia to finish reviewing our first Wikipedia pages for the BabylonJS framework.  They are so incredibly slow - and I haven_t_t heard from them in 2 weeks now. But it should be soon_co_ and as they are completely reliant on donations_co_ and work hard to produce verified factual articles_co_ I really shouldn_t_t complain.  So again_co_ this is a great article you_t_ve written_co_ and if the Wiki pages post soon_co_ we_t_re going to begin to get more and more press.  I also have a new application (written in BJS of course_co_) which we_t_ll begin to beta test at Weta in NZ this Jan.  We will also be working some press in the US as well as NZ and are giving BabylonJS it_t_s full due as the key tool we require to be able to build a first real-time collaborative design application_co_ and my friend Richard Taylor who owns Weta with Pete Jackson_co_ is going to give his endorsement of BJS following the 1 to 2 month beta cycle - and this we_t_re expecting to go wide with._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So as I mentioned to DK recently_co_ I not only believe_co_ but can guarantee that in the 1st quarter of 2016_co_ we_t_re going to see a huge increase in users around the world - and all due to articles such as yours_co_ which is by far the best introduction to BJS that I have ever seen.  Not to mention that Autodesk announced 2 weeks ago that they believe the future of their company and applications lie with their support and development using HTML5 and WebGL - as they announced their full backing and personal investment in these new standards.  We might all have been working in the trenches_co_ but now we_t_re truly on the edge of future content creation for the masses.  They will be coming in droves!_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Again Congrats RaananW!_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2015-12-07T20:14:19Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hi DB_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_thanks! means a lot to read that!!
