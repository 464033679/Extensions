And in ddition_co_ you have bothe Dad72 and Temechon who are on this forum almost daily_co_ and will assist you with whatever guidance you might need within reason - and they are masters in their own right as exteremly experienced and compitent developers in the babylon.js framework as well as other languages - so they will be able to provide assistance to almost make certain that you will complete your application (within reason) and/or drect you to wherever you will be able to find the answers you may need at this early stage in the learning curve for babylon.js - which from my experience_co_ is the shortest path to learning an extremely powerful content creation framework which I have personally ever been involved with - as well as an entire community of users such as myself who are all your friends now_co_ and will assist you in any way we can._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So do your research_co_ and choose one of these two extensions_co_ as this is what I have done initially_co_ and now certainly recommend_co_ and I_t_m also certain others on this forum will recommend the same.
