The same site is slugish_co_ slow or does not run at all on many mobiles when accesing through the mobiles browsers. I guess this is pretty normal since mobile GPUs are not as powerful as let_t_s say tablets_t_ GPU. So I guess the best thing to do is to test if the site is being accessed by a mobile device and divert the user to a mirror site where the textures are of lesser quality and the mesh sizes are smaller. Is that a correct solution? Is there any other ways of boosting performance\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSecondly_co_ will  wrapping the site into a Mobile app such as Cordova boost performance as compared to accessing the site through the mobiles_t_  browser?
