bone).  When root motion is applied all transformations to that root bone (rotation and position change) do not apply to that bone_co_ they apply to the whole mesh instead.  With root motion disabled you might see a guy walking forward_co_ then when the animation loops the person suddenly jumps back to the start and walks forward again.  With root motion enabled the transformations for the root bone is not applied to that bone_co_ but is applied to the whole mesh instead_co_ so if you loop the animation the man will keep walking forward till he is off the screen.  The whole mesh is being moved permanently.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn my MMA animation _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.punkoffice.com/mma_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_here_lt_/a_gt_ you can see both fighters start back at the same position.  Root motion is disabled here.  If it was enabled_co_ they would start in the position they finished and would keep moving forward till they were off the plane.  It is simply taking the transformations to the root bone and applying it to the mesh instead.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCurrently the only way I can see in Babylon.js to make a man walk continuously is to remove all hip animation (so he_t_s walking in the same spot) then to manually move the mesh back or forward.  That kind of technique just looks weird_co_ like the guy is sliding around.  Root motion is very precise.  There_t_s no foot sliding.  The data for the root bone is already included in most animations therefore it should be used_co_ not erased and replaced with weird sliding
