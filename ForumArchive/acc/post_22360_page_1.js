Can you provide an example of getting the value of a text_input widget assigned as a variable? Also_co_ I need to make sure that pressing the Enter key on my keyboard doesn_t_t execute a return - even when my mouse curser is hovering over the field_co_ as I need to get the text_input values from several widgets using a GUI button click. So if you have time_co_ I would be eternally grateful if you might either provide a code example for setting the widget properly without a return on Enter_co_ and to get the string value from an image button to make certain I_t_m creating the text_input correctly? Or if you have a link to any updated demo or page with this widget included_co_ perhaps the demo will show me what I_t_m doing incorrectly. I searched GitHub_co_ but haven_t_t seen an updated demo in a few months_co_ and couldn_t_t locate any reference to a text_input in the _qt_src_qt_ or any other directory/file.\n\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\tI also require a slider control for a video player I have.
