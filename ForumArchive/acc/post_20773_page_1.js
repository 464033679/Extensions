Don_t_t get me wrong - to be able to get anywhere near that number in a browser is absolutely astonishing_co_ but am curious whether anyone knows where the limit_t_s coming from. Can load the same models into MeshLab and my own DirectX code_co_ so it isn_t_t RAM (I_t_ve got 32GB) or the graphics card (GTX 690)_sm_ is the code limiting it in some way_co_ or could I get round it by segmenting the meshes and loading multiple models?

I don_t_t get a console error_co_ nor indeed an error in the browser - it looks like the loader just fails quietly.
