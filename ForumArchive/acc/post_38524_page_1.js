Even if you_t_re not needing the multiplayer client/server stuff it_t_s still informative for setting up a decent skeleton project that automatically compiles Typescript and reloads the app in your browser when files change. For my project I_t_ve since extended this to cover code minimisation_co_ copying static assets_co_ PUG template and SCSS compilation and rapid deployment to Zeit Now or Heroku. It took a bit of trial_co_ error and frustration but when it_t_s setup it makes development so much easier and more fun. When this project is done I_t_ll strip it back to the boilerplate code and release it as I think others could benefit and expand on it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
