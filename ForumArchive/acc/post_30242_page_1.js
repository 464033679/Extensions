Attack animation is animated in idle stance. That means if player attacks while walking  - legs stops moving and player just slides. My goal is to separate animations for upper and lower body parts. If player attacks while walking_co_ only upper part of body should play attack animation and legs continue walking. When attack animations ends torso has to make smooth transition back to walk animation. Here_t_s my try_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#SAUQTU_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#SAUQTU_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tClick on canvas to start attack animation.
