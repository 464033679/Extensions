I began by making a cube with a solid diffuse color. I wanted to add my own texture to it_co_ but nothing I did worked_dd_ it just showed my background color for the scene. I went to the example 04 on the Babylon.js playground for Materials and could not find anything that I was doing wrong. I decided to download the zip file of that particular section locally and see if there was a problem with my HTML. I still couldn_t_t find anything. I then ran the sample program and none of its textures showed up either. I can_t_t fathom how the same file would work on the playground_co_ but not stored locally..._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Please help me with this_co_ it would be much appreciated._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2015-02-10T17:18:08Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hi and welcome _dd_-)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I think I answered another question of yours_co_ did you manage to get this problem solved? _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_If it_t_s working online but not locally_co_ I would check the local server serving the files.
