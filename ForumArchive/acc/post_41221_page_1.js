Really glad you are enjoying your first steps with Babylon.js. You have mentioned in both your topics that you are creating a 2D game and as much as I love Babylon.js I would ask you to take a step back and consider using a 2D games engine such as phaser or pixi.js both of which have forums on this site. It seems that from your questions that you are imagining the game in 2D and this will make it dfficult to build it with a 3D engine such as Babylon.js\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Beny","Date":"2018-11-12T21:04:43Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\toh_co_ thank you so much JohnK_co_ I will give it a shot with Phaser_dd_-)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
