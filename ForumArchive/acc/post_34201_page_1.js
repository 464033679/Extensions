This works perfectly fine_co_ of course_co_ as the deck plans are completely flat - using the X and Z co-ordinates (in my case) of the curve3 I can match the outline of the decks with reasonable precision.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tA ship_co_ however_co_ doesn_t_t tend to have flat decks - Titanic being no exception. The decks are curved upwards both forward and aft. One (almost) solution being to create an additional curve depicting the deck on a side (profile) blueprint (containing the same number of points as the aforementioned deck outline).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have written functions to extract the x_co_ y and z points of any given curve3 path_co_ and could pass the x and z data from the deck curve_co_ and the y data from the side profile curve_co_ as arguments to my own custom curve. This would work in theory_co_ if both curves were identical - then the x co-ordinates of the side profile would match perfectly the x co-ordinates of the deck plan_t_s curve.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhere the poop deck_co_ for instance_co_ curves around sharply at the stern_co_ the x co-ordinates of the deck outline will get considerably closer together_co_ whereas they won_t_t do so on the deck profile - using my _t_solution_t_ would likely result in a very warped deck.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy solution to the problem is a simple one - simply line up the two plans and visually adjust the y input of the start_co_ end and control points of the bezier curve function (depicting the deck outline) to incorporate the curve of the deck - which is gentle enough to achieve easily.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy curious nature tends to get the better of me_co_ as you all probably know_co_ and leads me to ponder if there is a way to programatically get the x_co_ y or z co-ordinates at any given point of the curve3? Take a simple curve from vector3(10_co_0_co_-10) to vector3(50_co_0_co_0) - if_co_ for example_co_ I wanted to know the value of z at x_dd_31.265_co_ am I able to get that or calculate that programatically without being a mathematical genius or including a massive number of points and searching the path array for the nearest value?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_11/titanicComplete.jpg.5464605c234ebd914b8a6af63b69d0ef.jpg_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_15898_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_11/titanicComplete.thumb.jpg.71a75c3344e8296bf2f68b47a0c583b1.jpg_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_titanicComplete.jpg_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_11/genarr.gif.83a2effd9f983feb5860dbb98b5d77e9.gif_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_15899_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_11/genarr.thumb.gif.336fe8900ec67273bbce7eb07a7538f4.gif_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_genarr.gif_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jerome","Date":"2017-11-24T20:59:26Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/how_to_use_curve3_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/how_to_use_curve3_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tUnfortunately_co_ there_t_s no way to get a value from a curve at some distance or a given x value.
