Otherwise_co_ you can run into all sorts of problems trying to manage your GUI elements on a render canvas. As I often comment_co_ I highly advise avoiding GUI extensions and take advantage of the standard HTML canvas and CSS styling to avoid sharing your render canvas with GUI elements that often cause artifacts and many other problems. Some people might recommend GUI extensions for beginners_co_ however HTML canvas and CSS is so very simple to master that it_t_s never worth going down the road of limiting your UI to whatever the developer of the extension had time to implement. There are few limitations to styling yourself from scratch_co_ and far more advantages and immense power with few limitations once you begin building yourself. And this then allows you to animate whatever you like and/or use widgets in coordination with your HTML canvas elements as well as JavaScript to create rich GUIs and animated canvas elements for any user experience you can imagine. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI learned the hard way that I spent far more time trying to code a less rich UE using GUI extensions_co_ where in less time I can create a rich User Experience as it_t_s so very simple_co_ flexible_co_ and efficient building my UIs from scratch through HTML and CSS.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"adam","Date":"2017-12-01T04:16:23Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tPlease provide a PG example of the issue you are having.  Thanks\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Sebavan","Date":"2017-12-01T05:14:58Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can play with both verticalAlignment and zindex to respectively address your issues but as _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4289-adam/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_4289_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4289-adam/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@adam_lt_/a_gt_ said_co_ it would be easier with a playground_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XCPP9Y%23332_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XCPP9Y#332_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLet me know if that solves your issues.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"aWeirdo","Date":"2017-12-01T14:08:52Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_div style_eq__qt_background-color_dd_#fffffe_sm_color_dd_#000000_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm__qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div_gt_\n\t\t_lt_em_gt__lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt_BABYLON.GUI.Button.CreateImageWithCenterTextButton()_sm__lt_/span_gt__lt_/em_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div_gt_\n\t\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt_was created just for that _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ _lt_/span_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div_gt_\n\t\t_lt_br /_gt__lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XCPP9Y%23333_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#XCPP9Y#333_lt_/a_gt__lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t\ti just notised it isn_t_t on the doc_t_s page anymore_co_ must have been overwritten.._lt_br /_gt_\n\t\tbut you can generally find anything GUI related at _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/gui_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/gui_lt_/a_gt__lt_/span_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
