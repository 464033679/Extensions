as if work is more important. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_angry.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_angry_dd__qt__gt_   However_co_ you all missed a great show_co_ and the booth crawl (open bar time) was second to none.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_cool.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt_B)_qt__gt_  And it seems like developers of the female persuasion are looking better every year - as many of the women developers showing their games were far more interesting to view their demos with than I rmember in years past.  So it was good to geek out with not only dudes_co_ but also some very talented girls making games_co_ and a great show all around._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Oculus _qt_owned_qt_ most of the show with the largest booth_co_ and a line of people waiting to demo their VR and AR displays in which many people waited for hours - which I personally don_t_t get as I think Oculus is _qt_crap_qt_ (in the kindest terms) at best - but for now with very few competitors_co_ it_t_s at least a different and fun way to display content.  So good for them_co_ as their founder Brendan was our PA at my company back in 2011 -2012 while we were developing VR and AR head mounted displays for Lockheed Martin to be used on the Joint strike Fighter.  So _qt_ID_qt_ (who sued Brendan for patent infringement and other companies as well can sue Brendan all they want_co_ but I persoanally know where he got the ideas and the tech to produce the Oculus line of products.  And I wish him all the best as he worked hard to turn our technology into a consumer product.  Unfortunately for him_co_ the life of Oculus won_t_t be a long one as it un-naturally projects light into the eye through the retina and can and will cause damage to some users.  Zuckerburg is already begining to distance himself from the company most likely due to the pending and forthcoming lawsuits against the product.  But in the meantime_co_ people seem to love it_co_ and it certainly does immerse the user into a far more believeable world than a simple 2D screen - at least until the nausea comes on._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The next _qt_huge_qt_ breakthrough in my opinion is a headmounted display made by Magic Leap_co_ in which one of my best friends Richard Taylor sits on the board of the company and tells me what he can about the technology.  Richard is Pete Jackson_t_s business partner and owns Weta and Weta Workshop - as well as a brilliant mind and an incredibly talented artist.  His most recent comment to me was that Magic Leap will change the world as much as the invention of radio changed the world - and Richard never BS_t_s about anything - his word is more reliable than anyone else I work with in the film and entertainment industry.  He hasn_t_t been permitted to define much of the specifics to me on the techology_co_ but I_t_m very honored and quite excited that soon (in about 2 weeks) I_t_ll be one of the very first people ever to demo what a true VR and AR head display should and will be.  And if there are any of you who happen to know Richard personally_co_ please don_t_t ask for a demo_co_ as there is absolutely no possible way for him to set this up for anyone.  I_t_m only able to work with them as our streaming server technology and API for authoring interactive content within the HTML5 framework provides us with the potential to support their display devices and interactive accessories.  Less than 20 people worldwide have had the good fortune of demo-ing this technology_co_ so again I_t_m quite honored to be provided the oportunity to join the very small club of people who have had the opportunity to use this technology to date.  Unfortunately_co_ due to the stringent NDA I have to sign_co_ I won_t_t be able to speak at all about what I experience_co_ however_co_ I will confirm if it is as world changing as I_t_m being told_sm_ which I_t_m fairly certain this will be the case.  If you_t_re not yet familiar with Magic Leap_co_ there_t_s allot of info leaking out now since their first patent is now public record.  So it_t_s well worth taking the time to look at what they_t_re developing and how different it is from all other display technologies.  They also just received another 542 million in investment from Google_co_ and prior to this had raised millions from major players in the tech industry including investment from Qualcomm._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So in the meantime_co_ if you_t_re developing for Oculus_co_ I would only advise that you invest minimally in the infrastructure to support this display device and devices such as the Microsoft Hololens - since these and other similar technolgies have the same flaw which displays light un-naturally onto the retina with a high potential to cause physiological and neurological damage.  And on that somewhat negative note_co_ I still need to report that Oculus owned the show.  Not only was their booth the most frequented_co_ but there must have been an additional 50+ Oculus displays in most other booths which were demo-ing games and content.  Both Magic Leap and Microsoft Hololens are not yet available to show_co_ so there was no way to make comparisons between these technologies - we_t_ll simply have to wait and see._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I was very disappointed this year in the _qt_Independant Game Developer_t_s Mega Booth_qt_ which showcases independantly developed games.  It was sponsored by Intel_co_ so it was primarily games developed on and for Intel powered devices - although a few games showcased Unity as their primary development tool - still running on Intel of course.  But in looking quite thoroughly throughout the show_co_ there were no games I could find running in HTML5 other than support applications on mobile devices providing additional content for console and desktop gaming.  And as a greater disappintment_co_ there were only somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 - 30 independant games total in the _qt_independant games mega booth_qt__co_ so I was disappointed in the limited # of independant games represented at GDC this year.  Although_co_ many of the games showcased were quite good_co_ well developed_co_ and fun to play.  I believe you can get a look at what was there by visiting the GDC 2015 site._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Otherwise_co_ Intel has developed and is distributing a fantastic HTML5 Cross-Platform set of development tools called _qt_Intel XDK._qt_  Since the show_co_ my team has installed this on all of our machines as it is an extremely valuable tool for testing and debugging HTML5 scenes_co_ javascript_co_ and other code which expands on what is provided in the JS console - almost exponentially.  It is currently free for individual users_co_ and I recommend that anyone reading this post should download and take a serious look at what XDK offers as it_t_s a huge time saver for us already.  From everything I saw at the show_co_ this is the one item (tool) I would recommend to everyone._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Intel has also released their API for their RealSense camera and sensors and I_t_m sure this will be of value to many of you reading this post_co_ as it provides additional sensor data that is being adopted by many OEM partners and it is becoming a standard on many destops and mobile devices already on the market._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Unity had a really good showing of their new version release_co_ and although I_t_ve never been a big fan of Unity_co_ their new software and featureset is somewhat impressive and I believe worth checking out._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Of course Epic was showing Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) of which I_t_ve been a huge fan_co_ as I was on both the alpha and beta testing cycles the past 2 years_co_ and found it to be 1000X better than UE3 - in my opinion.  The new workflow is a bit difficult to pick up from scratch_co_ but at least there is some documentation now - whereas I had to learn by trial and error which was not really fun at the time.  But I highly recommend UE4 to ANYONE who wants to develop outside of HTML5 - which is often fun to harness the full power of your CPU and GPU.  The quality of rendering as well as some of the new third party lighting plugins  now available_co_ permit the creation of truly photo real rendering in real-time.  It_t_s fantastic given the tools provided to work with with these days._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_There is so much else I could speak to about GDC 2015 this year_co_ but I_t_ll leave it at this for now - unless anyone has specific questions I might be able to address - just ask.  It was a fantastic show_co_ and lots of talented independant developers attended this year_co_ and we (our development team) made allot of new alliances - and it was great to catch up with old friends.  The value for me was far greater than I had anticipated for this year.  And the good news is that we (the BabylonJS and WebGL community) is not yet fully represented in the gaming and content industry quite yet - so we are all truly on the forefront of where we all know the gaming_co_ application_co_ and content creation industries are heading - and I fully expect to see our frameworks emerging with a bang beginning next year.  Intel_co_ Qualcomm_co_ and many other key players were pushing in this direction this year_co_ and I_t_m sure we_t_ll see a much larger presence and representation of HTML5 games and apps next year.  I also hope we as a community can come together at GDC next year to begin making our mark as we all know where this is going.  Hope to see you all at the next GDC.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Dbawel_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Temechon","Date":"2015-03-13T22:55:20Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Heya_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Thank you very much for your feedbacks_co_ very interesting post.

so they_t_re not trying to say anything negative about Oculus which they aren_t_t saying about their own technology_co_ and certainly not reporting this to the media.  I don_t_t know the specifics about the _qt_reported_qt_ (strictly from a source who is also a friend) lawsuits against Oculus_co_ so at this point I would wait to see how things pan out_co_ and not worry about using the Oculus Rift unless it is for hours upon hours every day.  However_co_ as I_t_ve personally worked developing head mounted devices with Lockheed Martin which are in use currently by the military_co_ they have very stringent rules for how long a person is allowed to use the head mounted displays_co_ and that the risk is a real risk in potential damage to the eye and possibly neurological damage with prolonged and repeated use - so there is a real concern within the military._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But I really wanted to let everyone know that the technology behind Magic Leap projects light onto the retina in precisely the same way real world light is reflected and projected onto the human eye.  So not only will there be no potential for damage as far as we know today_co_ but the way your brain _qt_sees_qt_ and interperets the projected image cretes a scenario where your brain is not able to tell the difference between the real reflected light and the projected light._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So I was simply saying that these new devices will be on the market in 2016_co_ and unless you have a specific application and need_co_ I personally would avoid investment of time and resources in near field display technology and try to be first to develop content for display technology such as Magic Leap - as it is a whole new world for those of us developing graphics on the web.  And they also natively support HTML5 and Android OS._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I also wanted to apologize for using the word _qt_crap_qt__co_ as this was very unfair to the people who spent considerable time developing a head mounted display that many people find useful.  I simply know from experience that what_t_s coming next will literally be beyond belief when you actually have the opportunity to test and use these new displays.  What is coming is so fantastic_co_ that I find it hard not to just break my NDAs and describe it here.  But everyone reading this will get the chance to try it themselves soon_co_ and I promise that it will change the world as we know it._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Thanks for the positive response to this post_co_ and if there_t_s anything I can expand upon related to the show or products presented there_co_ please let me know._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DBawel_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dbawel","Date":"2015-03-14T05:41:52Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_I updated and added a few items to my initial post if anyone_t_s interested.  I also want to begin to discuss setting up a meeting at GDC next year for the BabylonJS community of developers.  If you haven_t_t yet attended GDC_co_ it was an invaluable show for myself and team this year_co_ and there was so much discussion and tools which were presented for developing in HTML5.  I would have missed out on a great # of tools and technologies which directly apply to HtML5 if I had missed this year.  So I highly recommend that whomever is able -
