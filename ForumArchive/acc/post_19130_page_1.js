My scenario is this_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I have _qt_detectors_qt_ (invisible mesh boxes) in my scene. When the player mesh collides with these detectors something happens. The player mesh is imported after the scene is loaded so the detectors are already activated.  Well I have one that is sitting around the position {x_dd_0_co_ y_dd_0_co_ z_dd_0}. So as soon as the player is loaded it fires the detector action (because the players_t_ location is 0_co_0_co_0 from blender). Even if I set the position right as it is imported. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Now I know of a workaround of just editing the players location in the .babylon file. But I was wondering if there was another way to bring the mesh into the new position without starting at the origin.  Any help would be appreciated.   _lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2015-12-08T17:16:45Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_You can also set the position in Blender.

The problem there is that I have teenagers making the models for the game(s)_co_ and for various reasons I tell them to make the origin of all there models 0_co_ 0_co_ 0.  Changing by hand in the .babylon isn_t_t a really a problem. I can just add it to a tasks in grunt. I was just wondering if there was a _qt_pre-render_qt_ way of doing it.
