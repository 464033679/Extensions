It became even worse whenever I rotated the parent object.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am sure this is a simple fix but I am trying to get this simple spawn point mechanism to work so that I can accurately represent bullets/rockets/etc.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks in advanced_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMatt\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-02-28T03:02:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHey Matt!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs your objects (the spawn points) are attached to a parent_co_ you may want to use spawnPoint.getAbsolutePosition() as position is relative to parent\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Matt Duffield","Date":"2016-02-28T04:04:55Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi Deltakosh_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat was exactly what I needed! \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks so much for the information_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMatt\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
