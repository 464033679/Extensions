Anyway_co_ you don_t_t need to know Blender necessarily_co_ as you can always work in another package_co_ and import your FBX file into Blender as a last step for exporting your scene to .babylon - which is what I typically do for my characters and often scenes as I prefer the FBX ascii file format - since it is intuitive to edit_co_ and provides me additional options to easily customize scenes with little effort.

If there are any vertices beyond what might make up simple planer objects to map feathers using alpha channels in your textures_co_ then you are most likely using resources unnecessarily.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd once you get close to reaching the limits of verts and bones_co_ your performance decreases more dramatically than you might expect. So as everyone answering is eluding to in their responses_co_ you definately want to stay far below the limits_co_ as your performance is impacted greatly even working within the acceptable margins. So most users stay far below what might appear to be _qt_safe_qt_ limits within the WebGL limitations on objects_co_ textures_co_ and memory - as everything is calculated as float64 in WebGL.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ keep in mind that many applications use z-axis up for their world space such as Unity and 3DS Max_co_ so make certain you modify your files or adapt your object_t_s axis_t_ and animation to work within the y axis up world space of WebGL. Using the free FBX converter/viewer_co_ you_t_ll be able to convert between ascii and binary FBX_co_ as well as to quickly view your FBX files and their scene and object orientation prior to importing into Blender and converting your scenes to the .babylon format. And I find that a limited understanding of Blender is useful_co_ and have been doing more and more work in Blender lately - working between Autodesk applications and Blender - since the FBX file format is far more compatable for most all scene elements than any other file format I_t_ve worked with.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"gryff","Date":"2016-08-16T06:04:10Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_140032_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_24427_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1471319006_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_dbawel_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t2 hours ago_co_ dbawel said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tAnd I find that a limited understanding of Blender is useful_co_ and have been doing more and more work in Blender lately\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt_ _dd_ david a convert ?

If indeed you medelled these yourself. And since you already have the models built_co_ I personally would use rendered images of these for some of the texture channels you will be using to create optimized low poly textured versions of the wings to replace the currently _qt_high_qt_ poly wing models. So instead of buildig new textures with alpha channels from _qt_scratch_qt_ using Photoshop or some other paint application_co_ I would render the images in your orthographic viewports with shaders specific to create really nice bump and other texture maps to bring out the true detail you_t_ve already built into the wing models. Then in Photoshop or another app you can quicly modify the orthographic viewport renders to create highly detailed texture map channels which will then look the same or even better than rendering the wing models in the babylon.js renderer.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/7026-gryff/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_7026_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/7026-gryff/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@gryff_lt_/a_gt_ - I can_t_t say that I_t_m a _qt_convert_qt_ to Blender_co_ as the workflow is simply very different to the years spent working in other 3D applications. However_co_ I_t_m a HUGE fan of Blender as it provides everyone with awesome tools which are as good as practically any other 3D application - and without having to dish out thousands of dollars to provide virtually the same or similar quality and tools as most any Autodesk or other 3D application. The only exception in my opinion is MotionBuilder_co_ as it provides very unique tools which if you can afford it_co_ will save any user working with character animation (as well as any proceedural animation) countless hours as well as dramatically improve the quality of most all character animation - including real-time facial animation without the need for using motion capture. Otherwise_co_ I recommend Blender to anyone and everyone developing in WebGL and specifically babylon.js_co_ and will personally pass almost every scene I creae through Blender in converting to the .babylon file format_sm_ especially with the exceptional work and support that _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt_ applys to the babylon.js pipeline which is used by probably more than 80% of the babylon.js community.

However_co_ aside from simply a few tools and features_co_ Blender is as good as any 3D software application on the market_co_ and provides the same level of quality as well as a complete set of features for 3D artists working in character animation and VFX_co_ which no one could ever say is not just as good as any other software on the market costing _qt_mucho dinero._qt_ So much respect needs to go to Ton Roosendaal and the now defunct Dutch animation production group _qt_Neo Geo_qt_ for not only developing the Blender software_co_ but following the sale of Neo Geo_co_ releasing it to the public as well as all source code for anyone to use and further develop_sm_ and maintaining support through blender.org which often provides the only resource for creating quality 3D characters and high quality graphics to anyone with access to a computer. I_t_ve personally donated to blender.org on several occasions_co_ and long before I ever used the software myself_sm_ and I hope others on this forum will do the same whenever they are able to give back financially in support of open source software_sm_ and specifically Blender which has been such an integral and unique tool within the open source community.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway_co_ I thought I_t_d put in my _qt_two cents_qt_ on this as the question concerning the optimization of the winged character appears to be answered. Although_co_ if there_t_s anything I might be able to add or assist with_co_ please let me know as I can generally provide some value to optimizing characters and the quality of animation since I must admit I_t_ve been around the block a few times now_co_ and even wrote a few of the tools now standard in MotionBuilder (formally known as Filmbox by Kaydara.) And I_t_m sure I_t_ve mentioned this before_co_ but I_t_m old enough to actually have been the very first person to purchase the very first Filmbox (MotionBuilder) license from Kaydara long before Autodesk ever heard the name _qt_Filmbox._qt_ and Alias/Wavefront bought the software long before Autodesk thought it worthwhile. So as I_t_ve advocated before_co_ I highly recommend downloading the fully functional trial version of MotionBuilder which is licensed for 30 days - just to perhaps understand why I and others wouldn_t_t ever want to ever attempt developing a character based game without MB as a key tool in the pipeline - not only to save countless hours and even months of work_co_ but to provide the highest quality possible in creating move trees as well as all other details of character animation. And not only for games_co_ but ALL of the Matrix facial animation was produced in MB - which I can personal speak to as the Facial Animation Supervisor for the films and the 2 Shiny Games we produced simultaniously with the films. And most recently_co_ the facial animation for the Hobbit films - using most all native tools which ship with MB - and which I mention this not to boast in ANY way at all - honestly - but simply to try to encourage and to offer help to anyone who is interested in upping their game (no pun intended) and the quality of their characters_sm_ which I would be very happy to provide ANY help with character body and facial animation using MotionBuilder and the tools which ship with the software. And I can certainly provide additional tools and methods which will set anyone_t_s characters above what everyone else is doing in any other framework aside from babylon.js. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo just ask_co_ and I_t_ll make the time if my help is of value in any way.
