This works great for wav and mp3 audio files but lately I_t_ve wanted to use generators like tone.js to generate tones with javascript. It seems that BABYLON audio requires a URL to insert audio into the audio chain but is there any way to use the audio engine in BABYLON with tones generated with tone.js and the web audio API without rendering them to wav or mp3?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-06-11T17:30:30Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tpinging _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5482-davrous/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5482_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5482-davrous/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@davrous_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2018-06-11T17:39:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf tone.js can produce an _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_AudioBuffer_lt_/a_gt__co_ or you can make one from all of the parts available_co_ then you can supply this instead in the BABYLON.Sound constructor.  Things are not looking promising otherwise_co_ though can you produce an Audio element?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"davrous","Date":"2018-06-12T19:26:58Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_m going to have a look to tone.js to tell you but as a first glance_co_ it doesn_t_t seem to be made to be easily integrated.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"xtreemze","Date":"2018-06-13T08:10:43Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_217798_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_38127_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1528738751_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_JCPalmer_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\tOn 6/11/2018 at 7_dd_39 PM_co_ JCPalmer said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tIf tone.js can produce an _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBuffer_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_AudioBuffer_lt_/a_gt__co_ or you can make one from all of the parts available_co_ then you can supply this instead in the BABYLON.Sound constructor.  Things are not looking promising otherwise_co_ though can you produce an Audio element?\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tInteresting that there are other possibilities to pass into the BABYLON.Sound constructor. But in this case_co_ if I_t_m not mistaken_co_ the buffer would not be real-time sound_co_ as it would somehow be buffered/pre-rendered. My intention is to use variables that constantly change per frame to affect specific parameters of the synthesizers so recorded sound would not be an ideal solution. Nonetheless_co_ there would be about 20ms of delay to play with so the sound might still be perceived as immediate.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_217960_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_38127_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1528831618_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_5482_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_davrous_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t12 hours ago_co_ davrous said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tI_t_m going to have a look to tone.js to tell you but as a first glance_co_ it doesn_t_t seem to be made to be easily integrated.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks Davrous!
