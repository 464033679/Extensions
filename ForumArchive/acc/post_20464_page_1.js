This has caused us some issue with loading but we worked around that by breaking up our files into smaller_co_  more _qt_digestable_qt_ pieces. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe were wondering if anyone had thought about_co_ or if there were any plans to create a way to apply animations to a mesh from an external file? I was thinking that separate animation files with just the animation data could be used to create and then play an animation. So I would load one mesh_co_ and then just apply an animation to it rather than loading a mesh and all its associated animations with it. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat are the implications of this?
