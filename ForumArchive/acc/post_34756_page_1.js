I have tried running CannonJS using NodeJS_co_ and while it was OK for 4-5 clients_co_ it became quite poor afterwards (even though I used simple and few geometry). Oimo.js doesn_t_t have any collision callbacks as far as I_t_ve read_co_ and Energy.js_t_s release seems to be quite far away. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnother question_dd_ it seems that the popular webgames you see on the web are being _t__t_hijacked_t__t_. By that I mean that the client code is stolen and are being run on a different server where they make profit. This for instance happened with Agar.io. To counter this_co_ you should preferably run a few things on the client and the majority of the other stuff on the server. However_co_ if a game has physics_co_ I imagine this wouldn_t_t work out so well since it may stutter or feel unresponsive.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDoes anyone have knowledge of this or can share his/her experience? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-12-27T17:11:06Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_199705_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_34756_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1514389063_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_18266_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_Threedy_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t1 hour ago_co_ Threedy said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tFor the record_dd_ I am posting this in BabylonJS since this is the best HTML5 3D game engine for the web and I_t_m questioning some of its physics engines and their use on the server. \n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBest intro ever _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt_1_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe do not support directly physics engine but we offer integration.
