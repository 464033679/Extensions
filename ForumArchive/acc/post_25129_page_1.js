Most of these resources don_t_t really tell you much details on how to make an actual _qt_big scale_qt_ game. If you want to actually sell the game or sell a service (Like MOBAs). These tutorials and videos only introduce you on how to use the GameEngines built in solutions for networking. Im really glad to see someone stepping outside of that and trying to make something from a lower abstraction level like using Sockets. And while NodeJS is great for these things there are several things to consider while making your own game. Now If you want to make a Browser based game that_t_s another things_co_ but when trying to make an actual fully functional Networking game system_co_ you have to recur to many more things in order to make everything work in a proper way.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnother thing_co_ you really shouldn_t_t ask people to look at your whole code_co_ maybe if you_t_re wondering how to do specific things_co_ you could use snippets to get things more concise and a faster response.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAbout the real beef of networking_co_ you can check this blog _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.game-savvy.com/2016/09/system-design-for-multiplayer-games/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Game-Savvy_lt_/a_gt_ and the multiplayer related articles (most of them)_co_ its about deconstructing game development and focusing on the system design of multiplayer games. It talks about all the things you need to take into account when making a multiplayer game._co_ all of its moving parts_co_ solutions and options_co_ for both performance and costs. I_t_m still writing to complete the Multiplayer game series. Its all about helping people make better games_co_ I_t_m a strong believer in the Open Culture.
