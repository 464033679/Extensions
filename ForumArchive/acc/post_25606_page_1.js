So each object must utilize collision detection_co_ and also detect and react to at least 2 spherical bounding objects which can move with the user_t_s fingrs when they touch the screen - and the collision spheres (two or three) must also not intersect as they need to also avoid collision suing collision detection_co_ but these are invisible to the user_co_ so I_t_m less concerned about this - but concerned about populating the screen with 200+ textured meshes capable of avoiding collisions with each other as well as the  2 0r 3 invisible spheres which I_t_ll scale when the screen is touched by the user for the 200+ translating objects (SPS meshes?) to react to colliding with these as well._lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_em_gt_As I believe _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5453-jerome/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5453_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5453-jerome/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@jerome_lt_/a_gt_ was instrumental in developing the SPS_co_ perhaps he might read this and let me know how screwed I might be - but I would guess he might also have the answer to my potential dilemma._lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2016-10-06T00:47:24Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI did what?  When?  If it_t_s more than 3 bhong hits ago_co_ I_t_ve forgotten all about it.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOhhhh_co_ the different font family/size for each character and removing one character at a time with the backspace_co_ without having to rewrite the entire text string?  Oh_co_ that_t_s just something to do if you don_t_t have enough pain in your life.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Sounds to me like ya got plenty of pain on your plate.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ sigh_co_ what_t_s the deal on the food poisoning?  Holy crap!  That_t_s terrible!  Don_t_t do that anymore_co_ okay?  _dd_/  Too late for the stomach pump_co_ and had to ride it out through the blood stream and digestive system_co_ huh?  Oh goody.  Complete system flush_co_ and re-install operating system_co_ eh?  Yech!  Sorry to hear that_co_ DB.  Phew.  What a grind!  Good to see you still alive.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOn that other front_co_ just punch that client in the mouf_co_ and do whatever YOU want to do.  (unless they are nice folk.  then you should prolly give it that good ol_t_ college try).  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlways remember... a _qt_requirement_qt_ is just a pipe dream that you haven_t_t yet spanked brutally and re-labeled _qt_a ridiculous idea_qt_.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Make sure your contract states that you work _qt_with_qt_ them and not _qt_for_qt_ them.  Make sure you _lt_em_gt_place_lt_/em_gt_ just as many orders as you _lt_em_gt_fulfill_lt_/em_gt_.  Stay on level ground_co_ or completely dominate them.  Keep them scared_co_ and don_t_t let them see you _lt_s_gt_blink_lt_/s_gt_ barf from food poisoning.  I could tell ya some stuff about the amount of servitude seen in capitalism_co_ but... no_co_ better not.  All in all_co_ never give away your power... unless you_t_re on the ropes_co_ nuts in a vise_co_ or over a barrel.  (where most of us reside 24/7).  heh.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOk_co_ ok_co_ on-topic...

Regardless_co_ I have to focus on the basic client sign-off today_co_ and will dive in this weekend to make further discoveries and improve my skills in this area which I have virtually no experience using physics and collisions in BJS. My personal experience goes way back to an application named Dynamation before Alias/Wavefront aquired them - look this up online if you have the time_co_ and you might see how dificult it was to build scenes such as the final ship explosion in the 5th Element - which pushed the limits of my abilities at the time. And I literally paid exactly $10_co_000 US for a single license in 1998_co_ which I_t_m now able to utilize physics tools (such as Oimo.js) which are far simpler to use than what I had to go into debt to obtain and use - not to mention the hardware costs (oh my God!) - and not so long ago (at least for me - in dog years.) So I hope everyone understand that when I talk about how grateful I am for the hard work and effort which many people have been and are putting into building the tools and framework we use_co_ I mean this with all conviction.

guess... if we have the velocity (direction vector + magnitude?) for both particles involved_co_ then we can set a new (tangent?) velocity  on both particles (a rebound/restitution) and then the 2

Ball impacts ground at a certain velocity/angle_co_ and the NEW velocity/angle is based upon the velocity/angle at the time of intersect/collide.  The intersectExit velocity could be derived from the intersectEnter velocity.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt would take one particle position update to ENTER an intersect.  Under certain circumstances_co_ it might take 2-3 particle position updates...

might cause two particles to have a 50% boundingbox overlap.  The quickest way to EXIT that intersect_co_ is to negate/invert the velocity of the particle_co_ and use the same magnitude (full reverse engines).  If the magnitude or angle of the exit velocity was not perfect inverse of the entry velocity... it might take TWO (or more) particle position updates (after reverse engines)... to exit the intersect.  We cannot re-check for intersect until the particles have de-overlapped_co_ or else we would get a false intersect_co_ because the two particles had not yet separated from the previous

position update moves it AWAY FROM intersect.  But if he used only 25% (example) of the inbound velocity... for the outbound velocity_co_ the particle might not clear the intersection in one particle update.  It might take 2-3-4-5 particle position updates... to get the intersect cleared.  During those 2-3-4-5 updates_co_ he cannot check for intersection of those two particles_co_ because they will show intersect... but it is an OLD intersect that hasn_t_t cleared yet.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWith me?  If so_co_ you guys are doing better than I_co_ because even _lt_u_gt_I_lt_/u_gt_ am
