This is the closest I_t_ve gotten to my first game_co_ and first time dealing with physics engines.  I really dont know much about physics engines aside from what I_t_ve read in the BJS tutorials and classes. Any advice or pointing out what I_t_m missing is appreciated.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ve working on this racquetball game. Its a combination of racquetball and 3D pong. I_t_m calling it RacquetPong for the time being. Once I get the physics right_co_ I_t_ll have to learn how to make it 2 player or whatever else I_t_m going to do with it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHere_t_s the playground.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#2B1VM_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#2B1VM_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNote you can left click and drag to move the blue square _qt_racquet_qt_ around once the ball comes back.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI was pretty excited at this point_co_ but as soon as I tried to make it bounce more by increasing restitution_co_ the ball bounces increasingly_co_ and then too much_co_ and it goes through either the floor or the ceiling. If I increase the restitution of the ground/walls etc_co_ it does the same thing.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIncidently_co_ the front wall_co_ the one closest to us_co_ is there_co_ its just invisible as seen from the back. The camera attachControls is commented out because I dont really want the camera view moving during gameplay- its meant to be static. The engine is Oimo_co_ haven_t_t tried Cannon yet.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI dont know what makes the ball go through the floor/walls/ceiling. Its like a _qt_collision fail_qt_ - goes right through. I_t_d like to know how to avoid that_co_ and be able to make the ball bounce around all over. Similar to actual racquetball.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnother thing_dd_ in the current settings saved above_co_ when the ball bounces back toward the camera and you move the racquet in front of it_co_ it doesn_t_t really bounce _qt_back_qt_ the other direction. I_t_m pretty sure thats because I_t_m not using the  linear velocity and impulse correctly...this was my first attempt. So I_t_ve got 2 main issues.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tEDIT_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI realize that if I allowed the racquet to move along the Z axis at least a little ways_co_ it would be able to hit the ball further forward. I may branch off into 2 versions of this game. But for now I_t_d like  to make the ball bounce enough to reach across the room and back with around one bounce on the ground/walls. Either way I seem to have the same issues...how to set my impulse correctly_co_ and not allow the ball to go down through the floor.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2016-05-03T12:43:40Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHoly cow_co_ Gson... you_t_re doing GREAT!  And what a fun and wise use of the physics engine!  Well done. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFirst_co_ _qt_ball thru wall_qt_ has been a problem for our physics engines from day #1.  I bet there are 20 posts in the forum... about ball-thru-wall or ball-thru-ground.  The reason it happens is something technical_co_ I hear.  Something about sampling/update speeds.  I _lt_em_gt_think_lt_/em_gt_ there are ways to reduce the occurrences.  One way that you MIGHT try... is to make the walls be boxes and not planes.  At least it is worth a test_co_ eh?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tRestitution_co_ yeah_co_ it_t_s seriously sensitive and can get out of control_co_ fast... especially in Oimo.  Your wise idea of giving the paddle some z-movement... is perfect.  In a real racquetball game_co_ the amount-of... and velocity-of Z movement... is a big factor in the game.  Perhaps there is ALSO _qt_English_qt_ in racquetball_co_ too.  That_t_s advanced stuff.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  You might be able to add that to your game_co_ eventually_co_ gson.  Maybe WASD keys for top/bottom/left/right English/spin.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAhh... let_t_s see_co_ how to let the user control the distance and speed of the paddle_t_s Z-movement.  hmm.  Maybe _lt_u_gt_distance_lt_/u_gt_ of Z-movement is not important.  Maybe _lt_strong_gt_only_lt_/strong_gt_ _lt_u_gt_velocity_lt_/u_gt_ of z-move is the important thing.  Let_t_s imagine that we keep controls... near the user_t_s left hand.  The user is already _qt_hand hovering_qt_ the WASD keys... to use ball spin (English)... so... hmm. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHow about the 1_co_2_co_3 keys?  Perhaps 1 _eq_ a slow/small z-move_co_ 2 _eq_ medium spike_co_ 3 _eq_ power slam.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_   SO... the user could be holding down _t_s_t_ and _t_3_t_ at the same time (back-spin power spike) or maybe _t_d_t_ and _t_1_t_...

What it means is that the ball will forever _qt_bounce_qt_ and not lose any energy during collisions. If it does lose energy_co_ it will eventually slow down and the hitting object will have to provide more energy for the ball to continue bouncing happily. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t3) Setting linear velocity and applying impulse is (almost) the same_co_ especially on inainmated objects.

Since the ball seemed to move_co_ i left it there to deal with later..although looking back I didn_t_t realize it was only the bounce and gravity that made the ball move.

Maybe a slider to change racquet size for difficulty? Slider for velocity for difficulty? Anyway I_t_m leading this into being my first legit contribution.

(ackknowledgments to those like yourself).    I really am going to put scoring up though.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI think because the ball is going further with fewer bounces_co_ we_t_re just not seeing it go through the floor - fewer opportunities. I wondered if putting in MeshBuilder instead of Mesh made a slight difference (still goes through sometimes). In fact_co_ I think the racquet is still Mesh.createPlane. Will fix it and try. I notice its after a few bounces_co_ like if the restitution is up and it gradually bounces higher...it will go through the floor. or when it hits two walls. It_t_s like it seems random_co_ but its not entirely. I need Nate Silver. Someone get me Nate Silver. STAT THIS!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have a feeling it will be figured out eventually though. I liked your fix. I wondered if something similar but more involved could be set up...like_co_ a mini module...it would take in locations along the X_co_ Y_co_ and Z_co_ and detect if the ball exited those boundaries...then put the ball at that point just inside on that axis... It would definitely take more than a few lines_co_ and it wouldnt_t_ really solve WHY its happening in the first place. And then the angle of the bounce back would be off_co_ or that would have to be figured out...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnother somewhat sillier idea I had was_co_ what if i set up another box and box imposter like_co_ another floor 1 pixel beneath the current floor....lol....like if this floor fails maybe it will bounce off the next one.. i have no clue how the engine is built_co_ what is causing the issue_co_ or if the number of floors will have any correlation...I was just thinking_co_ decrease likelihood? like_co_ in real life_co_ if we had problems like balls going straight down through solid surfaces_co_ thats exactly the kind of solution I would come up with. _qt_Lets put another floor just beneath the floor_co_ in case the first one fails! _qt_  But thats more code_co_ bigger files.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI think I_t_ve only gotten through about  30 seconds of Super Hexagon... was pretty excited....and that still only put me at level 3.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"webGLmmk","Date":"2016-07-21T06:23:12Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_10310_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@RaananW_lt_/a_gt_   _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5733-wingnut/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5733_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5733-wingnut/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Wingnut_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\ttagging you guys on this same thread as you_t_re the ones I_t_ve talked to about this_co_ but anyone else that wants to chime in_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_qt_m on the last step of the front end of this game (aside from scoring db stuff i_t_ll do down the road).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI set it up so the ball doesn_t_t launch until you click _qt_serve_qt_    woot woot(!)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt works the first time.

(travel speed) and rotationalVelocity (spin speed).  I changed the ball to a lower resolution wireframe model_co_ so we could see if we had any rotational velocity (spin).  There is none_co_ or little.  That is acting correctly.  Spheres do not have enough surface area at impact points... to allow friction to have much affect.  Besides_co_ all your friction values are set to zero.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAll is working good for rotational velocity.  Linear velocity... that_t_s a different story.  Somewhere_co_ somehow_co_ it is being amplified

is not being caused by the paddle.  It is happening after impacts (collisions) with the walls.  I don_t_t know why_co_ but I will keep thinking_co_ and perhaps do some more testing.  The issue would be much easier to troubleshoot IF it wasn_t_t inconsistent.  Why only SOMETIMES... does the velocity go crazy?  Hmm.  I wish I was more help.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd yes_co_ mesh.dispose()_co_ which all mesh inherit from BABYLON.AbstractMesh class... is the way to delete mesh.  I don_t_t think it is needed_co_ though.  Deleting/overwriting the old impostor... _lt_em_gt_should _lt_/em_gt_do
