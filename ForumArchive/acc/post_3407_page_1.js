I_t_m working with particle systems at the moment and have a specific effect that I need. Essentially it is a sun that has been created with one particle system  inside of a nebula which is another particle system. The problem is that they are not depth sorted in anyway_co_ so particles from one system will always be drawn in front of the other system. The order is determined by the particle system creation order_sm_ the last system is always drawn over the previous system. Does anyone know if BabylonJS has the ability to specify sorting for particles? I can_t_t find anythin in the particle system code_co_ but thought there might be something more generic elsewhere_co_ or will I need to add support for that myself?_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2014-01-28T23:45:24Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_You_t_re right_dd_ the particles are drawn with depth writing disabled_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I can create a new parameter for particles system in order to activate depth write for this specific system_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Claxon","Date":"2014-01-29T08:59:33Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Cool Thanks._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2014-01-29T20:38:27Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Could you try this version_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/forumpics/babylon.zip_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/forumpics/babylon.zip_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_You have a new property called particleSystem.forceDepthWrite _eq_ true_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
