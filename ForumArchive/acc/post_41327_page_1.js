The meshes that get rendered via babylon are exported as objs from magicavoxel (as opposed to having written some javascript mesher that creates meshes from voxel data).  I can make a decently sized level in the realm of 2 - 12 MB_co_ partially thanks to the game technically not using any textures (its just plain colors and vertex data).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHere_t_s an elaborate area from the game rendered in MagicaVoxel (fancy ambient occlusion_co_ shadows_co_ etc).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/from-above.PNG.190d0cad517c07b04bd48d0edc0786d8.PNG_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21019_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21019_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/from-above.thumb.PNG.79cb2505a2b73d753a1ee0c39a72a32e.PNG_qt_ alt_eq__qt_from-above.thumb.PNG.79cb2505a2b73d753a1ee0c39a72a32e.PNG_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut as we go in browser_co_ remove ambient occlusion_co_ and go for simple shadows_co_ things start to look a little more plain_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/image.png.2de3a0798c2573cf3d3bfb153d1e468d.png_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21020_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21020_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/image.thumb.png.e5eff6a90ac12bd0fee13a8c974326b9.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt_image.thumb.png.e5eff6a90ac12bd0fee13a8c974326b9.png_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt looks decent_co_ but I spent a lot of time just to get it to look this way from this particular angle. The shading doesn_t_t reliably add contrast to the scene_co_ and almost all of the contrast is provided by painting it in deliberately. E.g. a red truck against a dark road and light brick etc. It might look alright_co_ but this is a lot of work and it struggles with elevation change.
