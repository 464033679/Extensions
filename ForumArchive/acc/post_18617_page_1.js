I thought you could just create a new shadow generator and then use that_co_ however it seems that the last shadow generator which I_t_ve declared gets used and the other doesn_t_t. This means that or the terrain can_t_t cast shadows to itself_co_ or the objects can_t_t cast shadows.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPlayground link_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#1IP45_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#1IP45_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"iiceman","Date":"2015-11-15T13:28:17Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHey there_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tit seems to work if you use two different lights_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#1IP45%231_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#1IP45#1_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut not sure if that_t_s the right approach.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2015-11-15T16:58:39Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Iiceman is right_co_ light can only have one shadowgenerator_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
