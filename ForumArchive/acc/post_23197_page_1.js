First_co_ your playground scene isn_t_t referencing the castorGUI.min.js file_co_ so I had to reference my own on my server. So if you can change line #9 to find the extension_co_ this is a start_sm_ but not your problem. I use both castorGUI an bGUI together to provide me with virtually any function I might need. Unfortunately_co_ I use bGUI for all of my text_co_ so I haven_t_t run into the issue you have. However_co_ I_t_m intimately familiar with castorGUI_co_ and cannot find an error in yor code - so I would guess you found a bug. Fortunately_co_ _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5292_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Dad72_lt_/a_gt_ who wrote the extension wil undoubtedly come online soon_co_ and be able to fix quickly_co_ as I_t_m receiving a formating error in the castorGUI.min.js file.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy recommendation is to message _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5292_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Dad72_lt_/a_gt_ directly as soon as possible_co_ as he will see this in case he might not be on the forum today. And he is fantastic in responding and supporting his extension_co_ so expect to have a solution today_co_ as I don_t_t believe he is away and out of France right now. Although consider the time difference_co_ so you should message him on this forum directly right now.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFYI - I will be writing a post soon for general information as I have had the very best and most flexible tools to quickly build GUIs and GUI functions using both bGUI an CastorGUI. I_t_ll explain in my post later_co_ however using both not only provides me with any type of interface object_co_ but also allows me to use a single scene which works on every device_co_ OS_co_ and browser - without having to identify the device or browser. So in using both_co_ I never need to support multiple devices uniquely_co_ as these GUI extensions together do the canvas drawing uniquely on each device independant of resolution.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tVery soon I will be looking closely at the _qt_Dialogue Extension_qt__co_ as I see several unique features which will also benefit my GUI development dramatically. So I highly recommend that you continue to use CastorGUI_co_ but don_t_t limit yourself to a single extension unless you have all you need_co_ otherwise the additional and very unique functions of bGUI and Dialogue Extension will provide you with great tools to build the very best_co_ most functional_co_ and highly optimized GUIs I_t_ve ever been able to create - and with great speed as well.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLook for my post soon_co_ and if you need any help with CastorGUI or another GUI extension_co_ I_t_m certain I can assist.

Html5 is the present and future format for web games_co_ Blend4web is cool_co_ but don_t_t have a easy setup_co_ so babylonjs is OK for my proposal and classroom works.
