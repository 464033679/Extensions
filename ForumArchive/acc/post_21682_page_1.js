All services such as Google Analytics_co_ Clicky_co_ Mouseflow_co_ which can give you info about where user clicks and how long etc... and even can write video of mouse moving will not give me what is happening on canvas element at that point of time. Which means I don_t_t know what user is doing with WebGL.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI know that I can track what I need manually and store all data somewhere to get analytics what I need. Like for example send time when user start scene in Babylon_co_ and then get time when canvas element destroyed for example. But just want to double-check with you guys that I_t_m not missing some existing software. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2016-04-04T08:13:44Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThere is none_co_ AFAIK.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut modifying google analytics would be more than possible.
