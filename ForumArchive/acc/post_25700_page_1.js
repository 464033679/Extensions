I am basically loading an obj_co_ with a naming convention for that has a bunch basically blank meshes (they are 0 size cubes) that I later parse once its loaded with regex to identify its preset likeness.  Now I was able to get the positioning corrected with taking the first 3 values of the vertexData_co_ and setting that as the new Instances position.  But I cant seem to find the information for rotation or scale for the object_co_ which Im pretty sure Is stored on the obj file for each object besides its vertexData.  How do I access this information? Im I going to need to extend the object loader?_lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t*edit actually it looks like this information is not stored in a obj file... wow ok_co_ umm I guess modify the obj file and the obj loader to include this information?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-10-13T17:13:27Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tSounds like a good plan _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
