I can easily create decent ragdolls using ConeTwist- and HingeConstraints_co_ but for some reason they are ....twisted when I apply them to the current project.

Shoulder_co_ upper arm_co_ lower arm and hand. All 4 have bones influencing them. Now_co_ if you shoot the lower arm_co_ the lower arm and hand meshes are detached from the skeleton to create some dismemberment. But that would give like a minimum of 15 models_co_ and I_t_m not sure whether or not it would be possible to merge these and keep the weights of the vertices_co_ and then still be able to pick these sub-parts and remove them from the merged mesh.Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"adam","Date":"2017-07-08T15:32:08Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI just submitted a PR for syncing bones to impostors_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/2466_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/2466_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Raggar","Date":"2017-07-08T17:20:03Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tWill try it out as soon as the PG is updated or the preview version is built.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-07-10T15:25:07Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tPG updated (Thanks a lot Adam!)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Raggar","Date":"2017-07-10T17:23:32Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWorks indeed.
