I_t_d appreciate a little more on this if possible because I took a look at the sandbox site and tested in Firefox. Sure enough the whole page didn_t_t move but I have some observations_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t1) the canvas is the full size of the page_co_ with the bottom HTML footer absolutely positioned over it. In my situation the canvas is just a small part of the page.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2) I looked at the code and noticed the HTML element does not declare _qt_touch-action_qt__sm_ it only appears to be defined in the CSS where you also define the Microsoft -ms- variant. In my setup I already have touch-action defined on the HTML element and in the CSS_co_ so I_t_m presuming this is not related to the fix you mention? Incidentally I added that -ms- variant _qt_just in case_qt_ it was critical (knowing full well it wouldn_t_t be) and sure enough nothing changed.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWould be great to get some further insight from you.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-02-07T17:46:19Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOh yeah actually I remember..We had to remove it from HTML and only use CSS to make it works (sorry about the confusion)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Snouto","Date":"2018-02-07T23:52:00Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_204001_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_35506_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1518025579_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_4442_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_Deltakosh_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t6 hours ago_co_ Deltakosh said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tOh yeah actually I remember..We had to remove it from HTML and only use CSS to make it works (sorry about the confusion)\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tA quick update and check later and... nope_co_ still the page scrolls. This seems to be a bigger issue than I first realised.
