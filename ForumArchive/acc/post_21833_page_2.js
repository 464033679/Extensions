However I haven_t_t yet had the time to really experiment with using percentages from the conversion of canvas (X_co_Y) event coordinates. Although what I did attempt within the BJS master file was a incomprehensible mess thus far - as I really am not familiar enough with the VR Joystick to make any progress yet. But sometime in the near future_co_ I do plan on trying to _qt_steal_qt_ parts of the VR joystick and attempt to write something similar_co_ yet independant of the existing function(s). The reason why I would take this approach_co_ is that I_t_ve had really good luck in working with the CastorGUI extension using the latest build which now provides the option of converting (X_co_Y) coordinates to percentages based upon canvas size. Whereas I can and have now build an interface which draws very similar on practically any device - with the exception of my new S6 and of course VR apps - which I_t_m learning that GUIs for VR require a completely different approach in design and development.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo what I might try is to utilize the code within the current VR Joystick with which I_t_m somewhat familiar_co_ and write this as a fuction within the CastorGUI extension - since the extension efficiently utilizes JSON objects_co_ and I believe may have the flexability to solve some of the issues I_t_ve run into developing additional functionality within the VR joystick_co_ by utilizing the processes in which the extension makes use of the GUI canvas and JSON objects which are the elements in the GUI. But I have SO MUCH work to complete in the next few weeks_co_ however_co_ as I_t_m curently working in the CastorGUI extension quite extensively right now_co_ adding a flexible and adaptable VR Joystick to the extension is slowly being built in my head_co_ as I work through similar issues using percentages to develop single interfaces adaptable to practicly any device.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs soon as I get time to attempt this (and if I find it makes sense to use the CasterGUI Ext.)_co_ I_t_ll update this post or start a new one_co_ as I_t_m certain _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5292_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Dad72_lt_/a_gt_ would be of great help_co_ as well as your input considering your willingness to try practically anything._lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_rolleyes_dd__qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_rolleyes_dd__qt_ /_gt_ Of course_co_ perhaps I_t_ll get the time and find the good luck to use what I already belive might work - to actually work correctly.
