This would already allow me to guess at one serious issue - which is your use of textures. From the loading time alone_co_ I would assume that you are using non power of 2 textures_co_ and also using abnormal (X_co_Y) resolution (again_co_ non power of 2) as well as resolutions in X and/or Y above 1024 - which is almost never useful if you do the math on even the highest browser resolution displays which are running 2550 in X. And if you intend on using your camera to zom far enough into a texture where ixels are visible at 1024 X 1024_co_ then there are far more efficient ways to do this and you_t_ll discover many other issues when atemptin such an action.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo o course the first thing I trid to view was the JS console_co_ which after 10 minutes_co_ I had to force a hard shutdown of my first machine as no program would repond once your scene loaded. The same occurred on my desktop_co_ however_co_ I was able to get some response from your GUI - which was simply a _qt_working_qt_ icon - which again I had to force a mnual shutdown after 10 minutes of waiting. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo I certainly am not able to troubleshoot anything_co_ as my Machines and software are as FAT as they get. If I had to troubleshoot this_co_ I would create a single 512 X 512 texture_co_ and use this one texture in your scene to replace every other texture you_t_re curently using by name. This would be the fastest_co_ and possibly only way I would be able to begin to troubleshoot. Rename your texture directory_co_ and populate a duplicate with the same 512 X 512 texture using all existing names from your original texture directory. This should allow you to work on your scene_co_ and to quickly identify all problems - which are most likely problems with textures. Who knows what else might be an issue - perhaps nothing - but there_t_s no way for anyone besides you to troubleshoot this_co_ unless they have the same access to the source as you do. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFollow the advice above_co_ and I_t_m almost certain you_t_ll have an answer in short time.

Is there a reason why you need to use DDS files? In debugging this new scene_co_ I can see many errors related to the DDS format - including of course_co_ the _qt_Invalid Magic Number_qt_ error which is telling me that the headers of the files aren_t_t providing correct header information which is expected by these files as defined by the usage in your scripts. This could be due to these files containing more than 8 bits per channel_co_ which is generally the cause for these errors in the console. It could also be telling us that these aren_t_t standard DDS files_co_ and are often unique to a specific platform such as a development framework outside of WebGL which uses DirectX such as Xbox_co_ Game Cube_co_ etc. You will undoubtedly run into issues in using DDS files_co_ and to correct these issues requires loading them into a program such as Photoshop and exporting them again as DDS files - although if there is no need to use the DDS format (which I don_t_t believe was your intention for the final application)_co_ then I highly recommend using similar compression file formats such as .png or .jpg to maintain compatability at 8 bits per channel. But if for some reason unknown to me you need to maintain headers for what were once recognized as within the DDS file format_co_ loading these into an application such as Photoshop and re-exporting SHOULD correct the header errors and you shouldn_t_t continue to recieve the _qt_Invalid Magic Number_qt_ error_co_ as this is almost always an invalid header issue.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI also am finding many textures (most all) which are not power of 2 textures. I hope I_t_m not providing info you already know_co_ but many developers believe that a 1_dd_1 aspect ratio such as 150 X 150_co_ 200 X 200_co_ or 48 X 48 image sizes such as I see in your scene are power of 2 textures. Changing these to 128 X 128_co_ 256 X 256_co_ and 64 X 64 respectively for example will be far more efficient in bufferring and rendering_co_ as well as improving your CPU performance. I also see animated .gif files which I assume are being read as DDS files in their headers (providing some of the Magic Number errors) due to the animation embedded in the image files - depending on the application you used to write these files. And many files which have very abnormal aspects ratios require additional processing_sm_ and in reviewing your scene_co_ these are definately causing performance issues as well as massive amounts of WebGL errors. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo if you consider your average target resolution(s) for the devices you need to support_co_ the first step I would take is to re-convert all image files - specifically those used as textures in your babylon.js and any other WebGL functions - to true power of 2 resolutions in support of your target resolution(s)_co_ as this will improve loading time and performance dramatically. So unless essential to your scene_co_ I would convert ALL image files (including existing power of 2 textures) using an application which will correct all image headers to remove any association to the assumed DDS file format(s)_co_ which will correct most all other errors in the JS console and which are causing considerable performance issues.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI didn_t_t find any video textures_co_ however_co_ you might want to look at whether your server supports partial requests_co_ as beyond video_co_ there are advantages to incremental loading of any sizeable elements which aren_t_t necessary to load until the request is made by the user_t_s actions_sm_ however_co_ I personally don_t_t see this as a priority at this time_co_ as we need to review performance again once you optimize the obvious texture and general image issues.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ if I were to be working on this scene_co_ I would not make the _qt_tablet screen_qt_ which is represented by a plane mesh visible until the _qt_tablet_qt_ mesh(s) are fully animated into position in front of the camera - which is a simple task and will appear much more natural an action to the user. I hope what I_t_m suggesting makes sense to you. I wish I understood the language_co_ as I can only get so far in using your merchandising application. However_co_ once you optimize your image files and remove all DDS headers_co_ your performance should increase quite allot_co_ and I_t_m curious to see where else you might be able to improve performance - if necessary following the above recommendations. Otherwise_co_ you have built a very nice mechandising application. If you have time to write an english version so that those of us who are ignorant to other languages can navigate fully through the app_co_ this would help troubleshoot further if necessary. However_co_ as I mentioned previously_co_ this may not be necessary_co_ as you_t_ll greatly improve performance by simply optimizing your image files and re-exporting to correct your header errors. But I personally would love to experience all you have created in this app.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_em_gt__lt_strong_gt_EDIT _lt_/strong_gt_- Also_co_ I don_t_t see how you could possibly make this a playground scene_co_ as it is simply too complex to convert wholly onto the playground. However_co_ if there is a specific issue which you have_co_ then of course it is always worth reproducing a specific _qt_issue_qt_ on the playground for any user to modify and assist you in finding a solution.

I_t_m certain you know that your value on this forum is well noted by myself and by other users. And if you_t_re poor at this_co_ then I_t_m horribly bad - as you_t_re abilities are far beyond mine in most every way. I_t_m just happy if I can assist you with any unique experience I might have - which is only due to my entry into proceedural graphics when there were only three companies in the world producing CGI for film_sm_ as well as personally pursuing motion capture and computer animation before it was taken seriously and believed to be anything near practical._lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-05-31T03:57:35Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have to second you on that_dd_ _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/13038-nasimiasl/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_13038_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/13038-nasimiasl/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@NasimiAsl_lt_/a_gt_ is a pretty good WebGL developer!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"NasimiAsl","Date":"2016-05-31T05:52:37Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_div style_eq__qt_table-layout_dd_fixed_sm_width_dd_1171px_sm_line-height_dd_1.6_sm_color_dd_rgb(39_co_42_co_52)_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm_margin-bottom_dd_20px_sm_margin-top_dd_0px_sm_font-family_dd__t_Helvetica Neue_t__co_ Helvetica_co_ Arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-style_dd_normal_sm_font-variant_dd_normal_sm_font-weight_dd_normal_sm_letter-spacing_dd_normal_sm_text-indent_dd_0px_sm_text-transform_dd_none_sm_white-space_dd_normal_sm_word-spacing_dd_0px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(255_co_255_co_255)_sm__qt__gt_\n\t_lt_p style_eq__qt_margin-top_dd_0px_sm_margin-bottom_dd_0px_sm__qt__gt_\n\t\tI have to second you on that_dd_ _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5453-jerome/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5453_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5453-jerome/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@jerome_lt_/a_gt_ _co_ ...

multiple devices_co_ I do find a difference in fps between your 3 scenes - especially when I_t_m using devices with lower CPU speed and bandwidth. I_t_ve looked at all operations_co_ and the main difference I can see is in garbage collection - specifically Major GC. There is substantial latency when scaling your textures_co_ as the time for script evaluation is increased considerably due to an average increase of 20 - 25ms for Major GC. There is very little additional information provided since Garbage Collection (the differences between Major CG and Minor CG) covers such a broad range of potential memory operations. However_co_ in the case of your scene_co_ the cause for increased Major GC is almost definately the scaling of your textures in U and V_co_ as this latency is due to your processing threads stopping until Garbage Collection is finished_co_ as is usually the case.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI would assume that you should be able to improve your scene performance when scaling if you use a lower power of 2 texture resolution since you_t_re using the same texture resolution when it_t_s not necessary when scaling to a much lower display resolution per texture upon rendering. Keep in mind that you are also increasing the CPU calculations for interpolating pixel color when scaling and tiling textures when moving the camera - which is why the frame rate is dynamically lowered when translating (moving) your scene camera. So both of these - the additional processing required for color interpolation of your rendered mesh when translating your camera - and the memory management due to these changes represented by Garbage Collection - are definately issues and most likely the main cause for the drop in fps specific to your Playground scene _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1TYWYB%23114_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt_ style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(173_co_20_co_87)_sm_text-decoration_dd_underline_sm_font-family_dd__t_Helvetica Neue_t__co_ Helvetica_co_ Arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm_font-style_dd_normal_sm_font-variant_dd_normal_sm_font-weight_dd_normal_sm_letter-spacing_dd_normal_sm_line-height_dd_22.4px_sm_text-indent_dd_0px_sm_text-transform_dd_none_sm_white-space_dd_normal_sm_word-spacing_dd_0px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(255_co_255_co_255)_sm__qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1TYWYB#114_lt_/a_gt__lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(39_co_42_co_52)_sm_font-family_dd__t_Helvetica Neue_t__co_ Helvetica_co_ Arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm_font-style_dd_normal_sm_font-variant_dd_normal_sm_font-weight_dd_normal_sm_letter-spacing_dd_normal_sm_line-height_dd_22.4px_sm_text-indent_dd_0px_sm_text-transform_dd_none_sm_white-space_dd_normal_sm_word-spacing_dd_0px_sm_float_dd_none_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(255_co_255_co_255)_sm__qt__gt_ _lt_span_gt_ _lt_/span_gt__lt_/span_gt_ .\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-06-01T21:38:36Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLosing perf when all the screen is covered (so all the screen needs to be render) is not surprising.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAll pixel have to go through the pixel shader.
