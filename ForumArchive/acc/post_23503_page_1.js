So there would be one pointer at center (a dot ) which would move in all direction as you move your head. You can have 2D or 3D UI controls on screen. Wherever user keep pointer steady for x seconds_co_ it can be considered as click or tap.  So if user has to press button_co_ user has to keep the pointer steady over the button for x seconds. This is how normally VR apps does.
