I highly recommend using style sheets for all styling for a UI_co_ as this will provide you with the highest degree of flexibility across all OS and browsers. I find it hard to believe how many posts on this forum are related to styling GUIs_co_ but without any .css files referenced - unless they are built by a third party and used blindly by the developer posting questions. Honestly_co_ without a working knowledge of .css files for styling_co_ I_t_m not even certain how anyone can even begin to consider developing an application for client side browser. CSS files are so very simple to learn and fully comprehend_co_ and are the ONLY way to create a workable user experience. Otherwise_co_ you can only go so far in designing a user experience which provides any degree of interactivity. If you_t_re not fully experienced in .css styling_co_ then you_t_ll never build a GUI worth using as you_t_ll be extremely constrained by relying on others to build a work space which reflects the full capacity for tools_co_ appearance_co_ and functionality for the user.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPlease limit the use of any JavaScript styling wrapped into functions by other developers_co_ as this only constrains your ability to build both simple and rich user UIs. Just one hour of online tutorials will provide practically anyone with skills in the intermediate level of styling. And trust me_co_ CSS is just as important as knowing HTML since CSS is the only reasonable and certainly the most powerful set of structures to achieve the user experience necessary to deliver the content in any scene. And if you don_t_t fully comprehend CSS_co_ then you_t_ll never be a good Web or WebGL developer. I_t_m still baffled when I see questions concerning the style and behavior of UIs and scenes - when learning CSS is such a simple task - especially when the question asks how to make use of a styling function using JavaScript. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo please just take one hour and study CSS_co_ and you_t_ll find how essential CSS is to any Web project - regardless of the content. I_t_m not saying that you_t_re not familiar with CSS as I don_t_t know your background_co_ however I all too often find that developers new to this forum often come into this with little or no knowledge of CSS classes and attributes. Make your life and your work much easier and far better - just learn CSS styling - it_t_s beyond essential and so very easy to grasp fully in a very short time.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd if there are any specific questions in this area_co_ you_t_ll get an answer immediately_co_ as CSS is very simple to master and essential to master. GUI extensions are fine_co_ however you_t_re limiting yourself to whatever set of style types the developer of the extension has time to provide - whereas if you style yourself_co_ it_t_s much faster_co_ far more versatile_co_ and holds key advantages such as memory management and extensive animate-able attributes - not to mention the issues with maintenance in many browsers and OS_co_ as you_t_ll quickly learn that there are many HTML elements which are not compatible with all browsers - especially when it comes to media.and elements such as progress bars.

I make mention of this as there is far more flexibility in creating a unique user UI with very little effort involved (often less time than learning the functions_co_ parameters_co_ and limitations to the BJS GUI). Thus I simply recommend building your own GUI from scratch as it is so simple to do and everyone should know how to tackle such a fundamental task.

So I no longer use it as I now build whatever I need from scratch extremely fast_co_ but if you want to learn how to build rich HTML GUIs_co_ then his extension will shine a huge light on the basics of how to structure most every common GUI element.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut there_t_s also an ENORMOUS repository of jsfiddle GUI elements with all source code for whatever you require in your GUI.

This removes all limitations to your GUI built with any GUI extension.

What I was pointing to is that there are far fewer limitations in building much of your GUI on an HTML canvas_sm_ as this provides far more flexibility and allows me to integrate any widgets I need to also use on my WebGL canvas for the GUI. I point this out as I find most users on this forum rely entirely on the WebGL canvas and extensions created to build GUI elements and behaviors in the WebGL render loop - which by itself is extremely limiting and causes many potential problems. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is why I highly recommend building all that you can in native HTML and CSS if you want beautiful rich GUIs - and can also use JavaScript for unique animations on the HTML canvas. However_co_ this does not limit you from simultaneously adding GUI controls onto your WebGL canvas as they work together in harmony extremely well. I constantly read questions where so many people are trying to make the WebGL canvas handle all GUI elements - whereas using HTML canvas and CSS GUI elements permit you to also integrate WebGL canvas elements for your GUI - and together these combine extremely well and create far less issues than trying to do everything in WebGL. I_t_m simply trying to ask developers to look at their architecture differently_co_ as I find that many of the problems devs face on this forum are derived from the expectation that WebGL is the only framework needed to accomplish everything from soup to nuts - where I_t_ve learned that it_t_s far better to use WebGL for it_t_s core strengths - without tasking the GPU in pushing the render loop to calculate tasks better handled through the HTML canvas. This is why scene often have problems - due to over tasking the renderer when it_t_s often asked to handle far more than necessary.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"brianzinn","Date":"2017-12-01T07:53:19Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt_ Although I do agree that BabylonJS.GUI is not a silver bullet_co_ it has come a long way and is a supported extension. I built my entire game using html/css for my GUI and now I want it to work in VR_co_ so I am having to redo the entire GUI... so_co_ building on HTML canvas is generally faster and easier_co_ but does not provide that flexibility! _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_   Also_co_ if people want to deploy on mobile then they may choose to not have DOM (ie_dd_ Canvas+ for Cocoon).  There are pros and cons of each method - I can_t_t say I would recommend one or the other_co_ because it depends on the project.  I think any recommendation to not use GUI should at least include a caveat about VR.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2017-12-01T10:07:46Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_197115_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_33715_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1512085106_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_27533_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_Thierry Mil_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t10 hours ago_co_ Thierry Mil said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tBut the error is here with the instruction for the placement of the button btSoundIsOff (on contromPanel) _dd_\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_background-color_dd_#23241f_sm_color_dd_#f8f8f2_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm__qt__gt_btSoundIsOff_GUI.horizontalAlignment _eq_ BABYLON.GUI.Control.HORIZONTAL_ALIGNMENT_RIGHT_sm__lt_/span_gt_\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tFor me the button should go on the rioght side of the green-bar.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs I explained above your controlPanel is aligned on the left_co_ so all the elements that will be in this control panel will be aligned on the left.
