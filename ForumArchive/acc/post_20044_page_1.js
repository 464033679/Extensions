I am having an issue_co_ that seems to be closely related to this question asked almost 2 years ago.

Get the actionmanger to fire when mouse moves over the sphere.  Code works well if you get rid of view ports. It doesn_t_t work on its own (the hit test is far off in the distance)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have put an option2 in there_co_ that works great. But it registers a camera to a pick test every frame. And this is my problem. Constantly running a registerBeforeRender pick test on an object every frame for what could be over 100  different objects in my application. This seems less than optimal. Or does actionmanager just basically run every frame as well so there is 0 difference in speed/resources? Regardless_co_ I would still like to use actionmanager as its cleaner code_co_ and on top of that it is simple to remove the actionmanager by just removing an object_co_ rather than having to unregisterBeforeRender every object when it is removed.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThoughts?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks! _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt_true_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ChrisR","Date":"2016-01-21T19:46:04Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTo add on_co_ i just noticed that if i register my main camera as the last active camera the hit test works!
