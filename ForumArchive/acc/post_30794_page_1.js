When I comment out the hover states portion of my application_co_ I can get FPS up to 20. I_t_m not exactly sure_co_ but it almost seems like in 2.5 version_co_ Babylon is being smart about not rendering the objects outside of the field of view? Also_co_ I_t_ve noticed that when I enable the camera within my app and start to look around (so the whole stack of the hover states comes into view for instance)_co_ things start to get laggy.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy other suspicion is_dd_ I am building an angular library wrapper which I am using within my project_co_ which requires me to lazy load objects as it parses the dom structure. So point is_co_ when iterating through the 120+ cards on application load_co_ it_t_s doing quite a bit of work the first time it renders. Was there anything added or changed in 3.0 related to how the FPS gets measured_co_ or related to controlling how often the render loop fires? (pardon my ignorance if that isn_t_t how the render loop works at all). So to clarify_dd_ I_t_m wondering if somehow the framework is detecting that the scene is busy_co_ and since it is always busy on first load_co_ it uses that as a benchmark as to how often it thinks it will be able to render_co_ and then throttles the render loop accordingly?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_06/bad_fps_3.0.png.07a5d594180eb1e50d9bd6e02ea76eb6.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_13249_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_06/bad_fps_3.0.thumb.png.2970b2db183fdde4ab9d624f5789ea31.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_bad_fps_3.0.png_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_06/good_fps_2.5.png.2b0749955466d9395af3e76e33fc13b3.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_13250_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_06/good_fps_2.5.thumb.png.6c564b927804617ac2ed903406a50c29.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_good_fps_2.5.png_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2017-06-01T18:22:18Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDo not really know_co_ but would be interesting to know what is reported for _glVersion.  3.0 uses WebGL 2.0 if available.  Not showing in first due to currentEffect being expanded. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPerhaps AMD has issues with WebGL 2.  Try on a machine with NVidia hardware.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-06-01T21:38:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tCan you share a repro somewhere?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"thrice","Date":"2017-06-02T20:23:43Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_176652_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_30794_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1496353093_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_4442_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_Deltakosh_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t22 hours ago_co_ Deltakosh said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tCan you share a repro somewhere?\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNot really ATM sorry _dd_/ - I can paste relevant code in question if that_t_s helpful (in order to see if I_t_m doing anything stupid)_co_ but even then it_t_s a bit tangled with my angular library wrapper_co_ along with the larger scene_co_ so I_t_m not sure how helpful that would be_co_ but if you think it would help I can.
