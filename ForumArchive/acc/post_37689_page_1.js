I_t_ve only done this in two dimensions_co_ but given that a realistic map exists almost entirely along the horizontal plane I think the same logic from a 2D game can apply.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn 2D games it is common to have tiles_co_ and then we can convert the player_t_s x_co_y coordinates (x_co_z if in 3d) to find the tile coordinates. The tiles are just in a 1D or 2D array. Usually its a 1D array because javascript arrays are 1D naturally and some simple math can turn x_co_y into an index within the array. Some more math can then load the tiles that are +/- 100 units away from the player (or whatever_co_ depending on the view).  This approach can work for fairly large maps_co_ but at some point the maps are so big that the idea of having the whole map in a single array in memory won_t_t work.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhen these maps get truly massive_co_ we can no longer just have them in memory as an array... instead we need something conceptually similar to pagination_co_ where we only work with a finite section of data that comes from something much larger or even infinite. In games this is sometimes called chunking. Minecraft popularized this term. A very large tile map (just an example) can be divided up into chunks that are 32x32 tiles. Converting the player_t_s coordinates to chunk coordinates is just a matter of dividing their x_co_y by the size of a chunk (e.g. 32 tiles x 16 pixels_co_ or 0.25 km). After we have the chunk coordinates we can load or generate the chunk the player is in_co_ as well as any neighboring chunks up until we feel we have enough map to satisfy the view distance. In 3D this is going to be a similar process_co_ but perhaps there are some cooler things at our disposal such as LoD.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t know enough about babylon to guess at chunk sizes or what the general constraints would be.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Magilla","Date":"2018-05-17T02:44:52Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe main constraints will likely be the end-user - browser_co_ hardware spec_co_ and internet speed.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Luigi","Date":"2018-05-18T09:12:33Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tthank you _lt_strong_gt_ALL_lt_/strong_gt_ for the pointers.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_timetocode_lt_/strong_gt_ yes I am familiar with chunking_co_ in-fact I use it in Unreal Engine.

I think it is to do with moving forward before the loading blocks have finished loading. Try single one press on up arrow then pause before another quick tap on key. Not a satisfactory method and am looking at ways around it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCould mean going back to a loading screen during loading and making user wait until all blocks are loaded.  Then maybe rather than loading new blocks every time you cross into a new block load a larger number of blocks when you get near the edge of the loaded blocks. Since Javascript is sngle threaded there will always be a hexitation when new blocks are loaded.

Now only uses one buffer not three and that is integrated into the core blocks_co_ so a bit more like the original method. Can move in any direction but still with the same warning as before. Next stage is to see if I can smooth out the loading by breaking it up into sections that occur during the forward motion between the trigger points for resetting the blocks.
