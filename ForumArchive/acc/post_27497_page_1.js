Got to keep the old brain ticking over. I still consider myself as a newbie as far as BJS is concerned. Some forum topics are way over my head. Some of these I ignore and some I read with interest.  Is BJS developing too fast for me to keep up with? sure is but to be honest I am not worried as I am not trying to keep up.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am a newbie who goes from a background of programming and playing around with little projects that interest me. As 3D is of interest and BJS was simple to get started with and I got lots of help from the forum my interest continues. Having learned a little_co_ the teacher in me thought I could help other people by trying to explain what I had learnt. As I learn new things I will try to add simple explanations in my guide so that newbies who come at BJS from the same sort of direction as me can perhaps get there quicker.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHowever not all newbies will be coming in this direction. Some are graphic designer types who want to extend into 3D from 2D_co_ some are blender users who want to move into coding their characters and some from other directions. Will there ever be enough documentation to keep all these people happy? Probably not. Thankfully Wingnut has put helpful external links all in one place.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPerhaps what is needed is a what is your background what are you interested in type diagram and suggestions what to read.
