My answer was mostly concerned with some ideas on [faking] the latter.

I_t_m sure that taking the time to understand the maths of realtime lighting and shadowing techniques will be much simpler than the astrophysics involved in your simulation _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_\nWith regard to the shadow of the moon_co_ the reason I recommended trying a point sprite was to try to capture the look of the penumbra &amp_sm_ antumbra/umbra of the shadow_co_ which I assume can be precalculated as the Moon is always a fixed distance from the Earth_co_ and the sun is pretty far away (meaning the shadow can possibly just be scaled slightly and still be close enough)_co_ and as the Moon is kinda spherical so it_t_s shadow looks the same no matter which angle it is seen from._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_\nEDIT_dd_ TLDR version_dd_ you can probably use a point sprite presuming you are happy for the shadow to be a dark fuzzy spot that is painted over the Earth_co_ to better represent the spherical nature of the Earth ( which I honestly forgot about D_dd_ ) a warped quad might be better.
