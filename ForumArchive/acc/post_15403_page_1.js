In the meantime_co_ I have a comment on this topic_co_ although it_t_s not necessarily specific to his question.  _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I personally haven_t_t seen any posts on the use of bounding models to embellish detailed texure maps_co_ so I thought I_t_d mention this for anyone new to game development. This takes me back to developing games on consoles such as the Phillips CDI game console (way back)_co_ where we had vertex limits that would make you cry - often in the hundreds for an entire scene_co_ depending on the engine we were using (which was always custom to each game.)  We would create very high resolution detailed models in our modelling software_co_ and render a single frame from the game camera (which was generally static for gameplay) baking in all complex lighting_co_  We would then delete the geometry and save the simple bounding models we created with our compex objects.  Then we would map the rendered image of our complex model(s) to a simple planar object_co_ and parent our bounding boxes to this image plane.  This would provide us with all of the collision_co_ intersection_co_ and other object data necessary for gameplay. This is still the method used in games today for much of these types of computations._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And if we required any lighting effects_co_ we_t_d create a simple animated image sequence to map onto a portion of the plane texture using either photoshop or our original 3D model using the original 3D software renderer (for complex lighting effects.)  Of course_co_ always design the in game lighting to avoid casting shadows on complex models that are simply textured planes.  This was the primary method for building rich environments for game engines with huge limitations.  I_t_m sure this is EXTREMELY remedial for many people reading this_co_ but it_t_s not often obvious when developing your first game.  This is evident when we see developers post scenes and links to scenes in which we see models many times more complex than necessary with no benefit to the scene - only overhead.  And_co_ many game engines today run similar processes in real-time unseen by the player and even the developer._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I just thought I_t_d mention this process as one application (rendering complex models as textures to map on planes) that many developers use bounding models for and what some refer to as _qt_ghost objects_qt_ in optimizing scene overhead.  And just for fun (and to yank my own chain and expose my age_co_ ) I_t_ve included the _qt_win_qt_ endings for each character in a game I was the Animation Supervisor for on the Playstation 1 console. The game was _qt_Tobal #2_qt_ and was one of the first _qt_real_qt_ fighting games with a story mode. So if your character won the entire championship_co_ they were rewarded with their own ending.  Remember_co_ excluding characters_co_ the limit for all polys in each scene was 9000_co_ and this was one of the very first run time rendered cinematic games. I was the Supervisor for these cinematics_co_ but also had to create my own cinematics. Each artist was assigned one cinematic which had to be modelled_co_ textured_co_ lit_co_ and set up in the render engine by that single artist alone. This was the method on those days which was great - as the cinematic belonged ENTIRELY to the artist - which was difficult but something to either take pride in or to crash and burn.  Due to the tight schedule and lack of available people - I was short one artist_co_ so I took two cinematic endings - the characters named _qt_ILL_qt_ and _qt_Dr. V_qt_.  We all had 8 weeks total production time from pre-pro to delivery_co_ so it is what it is. But I hope that understanding the polygon limit for the total scene and looking at the result might demonstrate the use of bounding models to dramatically reduce polygons and other scene overhead_co_ while rendering detailed environments. So I thought this would be fun to post (it is for me)_co_ and we did win the award that year for best game cinematics.  And yes_co_ it is entirely in Japanese_co_ however_co_ we created all of the work in Studio City_co_ CA.  Ahhh... those were the days.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_cool.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt_B)_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt__lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsEmbeddedVideo_qt_ contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt__gt__lt_div_gt__lt_iframe width_eq__qt_480_qt_ height_eq__qt_270_qt_ src_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.youtube.com/embed/nykxTAzocNI?feature_eq_oembed_qt_ frameborder_eq__qt_0_qt_ allowfullscreen_eq__qt_true_qt__gt__lt_/iframe_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dsman","Date":"2015-06-27T04:56:50Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_@jahow  This was so simple and indigenous.
