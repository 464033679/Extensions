This format allows the addon to be multiple files / directories_co_ as well as enables other types of files to be included (even .BLEND files).\n- Meshes can now be directed to ignore that they have a skeleton for export purposes.\n- Base classes for meshes may have `postConstruction()` method.  This is so you can automatically run code as part of the construction process which depends on the geometry already existing.  This cannot be located in the constructor of the base class_co_ since this must be run as the first line of the sub-class.\n- Certain things will now prohibit the generation of an export file_co_ in order to reduce reports of known problems / un-necessary support_dd_\n    - Minumim Blender version checking.  Current minimum is 2.76.\n    - Meshes with un-applied rotation or scale which also have skeletons.\n- Leading 0_t_s from numbers have been removed.  This can reduce a source file up to 10%_co_ given that exports are mostly floating point numbers and types like normals_co_ matrix weights_co_ UV_co_ &amp_sm_ shape keys values are all less than 1 (or -1).  JSON does not allow this (pussies)_co_ so this only applies to .JS format.\n- The `This Layer Only` checkbox on the Light data properites tab is now used.  When checked_co_ the `includedOnlyMeshesIds` property of the light is now exported with the values of those meshes that are also on the same layer as the light.\n- Maximum Simultaneous Lights property has been added to the mesh data properties tab.  This is applied to all materials of the mesh.\n- There are few changes for Shape Key Groups_dd_\n    - A group_co_ identified by as text prior to a _t_-_t_ in the key name_co_ no longer contains a basis key.  This is derived on load using the `positions` of the mesh it is part of.  This reduces file size.\n    - There are 2 operators (buttons)_co_ `Archive Shapekeys` and `Restore Shapekeys`_co_ on the Mesh data properties tab.  These facilitate the transfer of shape keys between different .BLEND files by writing / reading a `.TOB` file of the shapekeys of all selected meshes.  This is very useful for deriving shapekeys using a specific skeleton_co_ then using them in a different version of the mesh &amp_sm_ skeleton.\n    - There are 2 operators (buttons)_co_ `Pose lib to Shape keys` &amp_sm_ `Pose to Shape Key`_co_ on the Armature data properties tab.\n- In support of Skeleton pose interpolation in `Queued Interpolation` extension_dd_\n    - There is an operator (button)_co_ `Export`_co_ on the Armature data properties tab.  This makes a separate .JS export file of all the poses of the Blender Pose Libraries in the .BLEND_co_ represented as a `QI.SkeletonPoseLibrary`.\n    - If you do not specify a base class for a mesh_co_ it will assign the class `QI.Mesh` when it has either shape keys or an armature.\n\n##Fixed in 5.0##\n- Cycles exports now works for Blender 2.77.  There was a syntax change for 2.77.  The exporter detects the version of Blender and makes API calls appropriately.\n- When there are multiple meshes with actions in a .BLEND_co_ it is not possible to determine which meshes participate in which actions.  When there is an action which is only done by one Mesh_co_ place the mesh name then a _t_-_t_ in the name of the action to isolate it._lt_/code_gt__lt_/pre_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"gryff","Date":"2016-08-05T18:29:29Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_138931_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_24308_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1470417539_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_JCPalmer_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t1 hour ago_co_ JCPalmer said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\t_qt_How do I un-install the old version_qt_.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt__dd_ it will depend on how you installed the add on Jeff.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t1.
