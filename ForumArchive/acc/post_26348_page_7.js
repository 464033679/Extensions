I_t_m gonna to use blend4web as I said ... now I found a solution for gazing too(just not sleeping one night) ... I didn_t_t find gazing (as I said I hate searching in a lot of written stuff) but I solve it with put an object in front of camera and make camera as a parent of it so I have pointer(the behaviour is exactly like Pointer)( for me it is better beacuse i Want to Change Cursor And With Babylon i have to suffer the whole internet just to find a simple changing .... and a good thing for me is that  I can change the pointer to whatever shape  that I like... ( but in Babylon you have to begg for just changing the loader page And all of them was like Secret beacuse Babylon group like to have own Icon  ) all things were customized ...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.youtube.com/user/ianscott888_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.youtube.com/user/ianscott888_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is one of the person who teach blend4web...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI recommend you that you do it like this guy ...if you Want to publish your package ....
