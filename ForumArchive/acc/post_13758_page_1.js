DO NOT use the same mesh as the ground.  Instead they are ways to place other mesh atop the ground_co_ and each of those other mesh textures has an alpha component (transparent background)_co_ so they APPEAR to be part of the ground mesh texture_co_ but are instead... over-layed.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf you NEED tire tread patterns_co_ you will need to use the decals method_co_ or manually place planes with tire tread texture... into the scene yourself.  Decals are easier_co_ because they have the abilities to conform to heightMapped ground (see the decals-for-heightMaps information and playground demo by bullisor... _lt_strong_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/12974-decals/page-4#entry78007_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_here_lt_/a_gt__lt_/strong_gt_).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf black marks are fine_co_ and no tire tread pattern is needed_co_ I would use invisible-emitter particle sprayers placed near the base of the tires and parented to something on the car_co_ so they travel along WITH the car tires.  Particle sprayers would handle car turns nicely_co_ leaving _qt_curl_qt_ patterns when the car is doing _qt_drifts_qt_... and would get longer when the car was going faster... and be shorter when the car is going slower... all automatically.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut_co_ you didn_t_t mention a car.  Just tire tracks.  So_co_ I_t_m getting ahead of the situation to a degee.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  If you ONLY need tire tracks and don_t_t need the tracks to be produced at the back of a moving car_co_ then its easy... use decals with tire track textures.  Tire tracks made using decals... will travel up over mountains and through rivers just fine... following heightMap contour the whole way_co_ automatically.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf you use particles_co_ it will take a bit of tweaking of the particle system so that the particles emit FLAT along the ground plane (parallel to it) and you will need to set the particle gravity to zero so the particles dont fall thru the ground.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYep_co_ it can be done_co_ and in more than one way.  Maybe these are not the solutions you had hoped-for... but they will get the job done in a nice realistically-fake way.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Good luck.  Keep us posted.  Others will likely have more comments... so stay tuned.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"surmariusz","Date":"2015-04-10T13:35:49Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Thank you for so much.
