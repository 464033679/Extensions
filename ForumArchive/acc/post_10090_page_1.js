Currently_co_ I_t_m using node.js for my server_co_ and the plan is to make it authoritative as well. Our plan (which we_t_re right in the middle of implementing) is to use cannon.js on both sides_co_ and to sync trajectory and velocity on player input_co_ with periodic position/orientation syncs at a much lower rate. (I_t_ll explain why in a bit.)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_There_t_s some intersting problems you need to solve with an architechture like this_co_ and I_t_m not going to lie_co_ it_t_s nontrivial. Ignoring the details of physics or collision_sm_ let_t_s just say you want to move a cube around on the screen. Every player has their own cube_co_ and can see all other player_t_s cubes. Server is authoritative on state. The first thing you try would be simply sending a message to the server every time your cube_t_s position changes. The server calculates the move_co_ and your client updates to what the server calculated._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In a perfect world_co_ this would be correct_co_ and fine. Client and Server would never disagree_co_ everything would be smooth_co_ and you_t_d be done. Unfortunately_co_ here_t_s where reality sets in. In the real world_co_ there_t_s going to be some latency between the client and server. You always want that as low as possible_co_ but you need your game to be playable between 15ms (I_t_ve never seen lower on my home Cable internet) and 100ms (high_co_ but not uncommon in rural areas). For comparison_co_ 60fps means each frame is ~16.7ms long. According to the _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.fcc.gov/measuring-broadband-america/2013/February_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_FCC_lt_/a_gt_ latency seems to average ~31ms in the United States_co_ so_co_ call that 2 frames. If something is moving at a decent speed on screen_co_ the distance it covers in two frames can be huge_sm_ which means that you_t_d end up with the following scenario_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_ul_gt__lt_li_gt_Player moves box on screen_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Client sends update to server_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Wait 16ms_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Server calculates position_co_ sends to client_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Wait 16ms_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Client gets update_co_ and applies it_lt_/li_gt__lt_li_gt_Box moves to position it was in 2 frames ago_lt_/li_gt__lt_/ul_gt__lt_p_gt_That might not sound bad_co_ but trust me_co_ it_t_s often what players mean when they call things _qt_laggy_qt_ or _qt_jittery_qt_ in a multiplayer game. So_co_ what can you do? Well_co_ the common solution is for the client to know how much time has passed since the message was sent. Then_co_ it would run the result through it_t_s own calculations_co_ to try and build an _t_far forwarded_t_ message from the server_co_ and apply that. Now_co_ this does work (and for some types of games_co_ it works really well!)_co_ but it has it_t_s shortcommings as well. Without turning this into (more of) a discertation on the difficulties in networked games_co_ I_t_ll just say that this method has problems with _t_teleporting_t_ players_co_ and relatively high bandwidth requirements._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_My preference is to go the route of WoW. You send the server some representation of player input (not key presses_co_ but something like a velocity vector)_co_ and it distributes that to everyone. Client track their latency from the server_co_ and use the _t_fast forwarding_t_ trick on these messages. For the most part_co_ since the client and server are calculating things the same way_co_ they should share a close enough view of the world. But_co_ to make sure_co_ you periodically (once a second_co_ once ever 30 seconds_co_ it really depends...) send a position and orientation to the client. For things not controlled by the player_co_ simply update them. For something controlled by the player_co_ however_co_ even small jerks can really affect gameplay_co_ so I_t_d maintain a hidden object that_t_s from the server_co_ and have the player_t_s avatar attempt to smoothly update to the server representation. Player input would control the avatar directly_co_ but also send the updates to the server. Then_co_ you need to pick a threshold of difference between the hidden server avatar and the player avatar_sm_ over this threshold you do a single _t_jump_t_ to update._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I know this is probably way more than you were thinking about getting into right now_co_ but I_t_ve been down this road many a time_sm_ figured I might as well share my map of the land. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"tajen","Date":"2014-10-30T17:24:25Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Yeah_co_ I have read several articles about multiplayer and its problems_co_ for example_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As I am normally used to doing backend_co_ non-mathematical programming_co_ and really just started to play around with graphics/physics_co_ I find the matrices and vectors more scary than a little lag.. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ But I will try and see if I am able to extract the essential parts and make a server version.
