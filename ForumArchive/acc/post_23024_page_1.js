Generally_co_ this is how fov and other values are calculated in the _qt_virtual_qt_ space of the camera to approximate how light passes through a physical lens and render a reasonably accurate image relative to a physical camera. I haven_t_t looked at the math specific to babylon.js_co_ but I assume that you_t_ll find the computation of the frustom is similar to that of OpenGL and DirectX - as well as other APIs.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope this helps.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ragingclaw","Date":"2016-08-09T17:31:51Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tthis helped me. that is all. carry on with your bad selves.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2016-08-10T19:30:24Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt_ is all mushroomed-up_co_ again...
