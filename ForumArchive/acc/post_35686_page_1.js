The thing is that I noticed that my application can be quite slow sometimes and I think it will be bad for the following of my project.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAfter some recherch I came accross some SceneOptimization tutorials and I applied them_co_ without much results... I also tried to remove every shadows on the game but there is still some major fps drops\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThats why I finally come to you with the hope that someone can help me.
