I_t_m always overly causious to adopt new builds_co_ and have always been required to do a technology lock for product release at some point. I haven_t_t yet had any issues with babylon.js builds for compatability_co_ but as many people say _qt_If it aint broke_co_ don_t_t risk breaking it._qt_ But since there is almost always a performance boost with every new release_co_ and not simpy added functionality_co_ what do you think the primary benefits are to version 2.4?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd I would appriciate hearing from anyone who has contributed to the latest version as well_co_ as I truly appriciate all of the hard work done by so many everyday to make this the best framework I_t_ve ever worked with.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFYI - we finally ship the beta of our multiuser real time design app to Weta in 2 weeks (if all goes as planned.) I am in the middle on a substancial re-write of the structure and architecture of the app_co_ and all appears to be going well. But the really great news is that I spoke with Richard Taylor and Peter Jackson late last week_co_ and they are both extremely happy to publicly endorse my company and app_co_ as well as my request for them to publicly endorse babylon.js. In the app itself_co_ on the about page I_t_m listing _qt_powered by babylon.js_qt_ and making it very clear to the public that I could not have ever produced such an app with so much functionality and usability without the babylon framework and this fantastic community. So it is a huge priority for me to do whatever I can to help grow this community_sm_ and I believe that a public endorsement for babylon.js by individuals like Peter Jackson_co_ Richard Taylor_co_ and Jim Cameron will help promote this framework to a much wider audience. Variety magazine and Entertainment Engeneering magazine among others will be writing articles with substantial focus on the app_co_ technology_co_ and specifically the babylon.js framework when we release to the public in approximately 120 days. And this will definately be read by millions of people as Pete and Richard don_t_t often endorse technology specifically. So I believe this is quite an exciting time to be a part of the future of entertainment applications which is WebGL_co_ and more specifically Babylon.js.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway_co_ enough of the sideline here_co_ as I I_t_m writing to ask all of the large brains and super users on this forum (you know who you are) to sum up your personal thoughts on the advantages in performance in adopting babylon.js V2.4.
