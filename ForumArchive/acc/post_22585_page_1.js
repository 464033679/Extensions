Next_co_ try to split it in an optimal way... if you have lots of little meshes inside the house for furniture and things_co_ try joining them together to reduced mesh count where possible. For larger models like houses you can also split areas that can_t_t be seen at the same time into multiple meshes so the bits that can_t_t be seen can be culled away.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"andyram","Date":"2016-05-16T09:28:05Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks Dal_co_ Is there any link or documentation that i can refer to get more idea about splitting areas as you said?  i have very less idea about it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"gryff","Date":"2016-05-16T14:37:50Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\tQuote\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tit had around 6 million vertices  and fps was not impressive.
