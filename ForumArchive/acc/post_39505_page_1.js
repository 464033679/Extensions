To me more specific what I am trying to do is at a given frame flip them so that the front face becomes the back faces. I had thought that simply flipping the normals was going to do the trick so I set them all to -1 when I wanted to make the change. Since I have blackface culling set to true I had thought that when I set the normals to -1 that the back faces that were invisible would become visible etc. Anyway advice on where I might be going wrong?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JonVarner","Date":"2018-08-18T23:44:09Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOk_co_ so as it often goes I had a light bulb moment the moment I pressed send. My problem was that I was setting all of the normals to -1 when I just needed to flip the normal facing the direction I wanted to flip the face.
