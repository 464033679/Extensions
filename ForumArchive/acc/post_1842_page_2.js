There are some compression artifacts in the image from the forum due to it being a jpg (and jpgs being a lossy format). I recommend using png format if you_t_re not_co_ since that uses lossless compression. If you were using a jpg it would just increase the chances of these skybox artifacts. Also I noticed the dimensions of your image are 1600 x 1200. Have you tried altering them to the nearest powers of 2 eg. 2048 x 1024?
