Now_co_ to achieve that_co_ I need to import different mesh for every animation_co_ because I need correct weight data for those animated skeletons to work. Meaning I need to import 1st character * 17 times_co_ 2nd*17_co_ 3rd*17.

There are a couple of things you can do depending on your assets to load only three meshes total for all of your needs.Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf your characters are similar in form_co_ say all humanoid bipeds_co_ and share some animations you will want to use animation retargeting to reduce your mesh load. What this means is that all of your meshes need to share the same skeletal structure_co_ both in heirarchy and naming_co_ and you can pass an animation from one skeleton to another. That means you only need to include the animations in one of your incoming characters and then pass the animation clips to any other skeleton and the rotational information from the skeleton will work. You could even import a default character with all the animations that never is rendered on screen but allows you to add more character styles independently of your animation rig. Each individual character carries their own skin weighting so the joints on target models can even be in a different proportion than the default model so long as the animations take this variance into account (say one model has a longer torso or shorter legs).Â This is the most forward thinking path because it separates your animation pipeline from your character pipeline.Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe key to this is that you need to pack all of your animations in one timeline for export. I would leave blank frames in between each clip to eliminateÂ interpolation errors_co_ maybe 10 unkeyed frames between clips_co_ in any order that makes sense to you. Once you have your timeline filled with all animations you will need (51 in your case if none are similar like walk or idle) export the file as normal. If you are using Maya_co_ you can author your clips on export with the clip tool in Maya which you can find under the Babylon Menu_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21097_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/MayaBabylonAnimations.png.3e7c1fe88cf1cb498ac689ae734b9619.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt_MayaBabylonAnimations.png.3e7c1fe88cf1cb498ac689ae734b9619.png_qt_ /_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCreate a new clip for each animation_co_ giving it a name and start/end frame. If you then drop your model into the Babylon.js sandbox_co_ you will see the first animation in the list playing and have the ability to change to any animation with the drop down on the footer bar.Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf you aren_t_t using Maya_co_ you can manually create your clips as variables in your code which can be found in our _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/animations_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_animation docs_lt_/a_gt_. The best example of this is the animation blending example_dd_Â _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#BCU1XR%230_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#BCU1XR#0_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe other way to do this if you don_t_t have shared animations is to keep each character_t_s animation in their own file. This is the best path if you don_t_t share character structure_co_ as in one is a biped and another is a quadruped. This makes each character file individually larger as you carry the curve information in each file so you have a trade off for download of the characters. This makes the shared animation method more desireable if you can swing it_co_ even if there is one more default mesh that holds all animations as your characters are more flexible and lighter on download.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis method is also useful if you want to vary up animations and have multiple idle animations that randomly sequence. Containing all clips in one file and randomly choosing one to play when the character idles will make your game feel more dynamic.Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope this helps point you in a direction that allows you to get the most flexibility out of your characters and still not have to load more meshes than you need.
