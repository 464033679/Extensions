to store all your Hermites in Catmull ROM.  haha.  (too early for fillet and chamfer humor?)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn order to stay compatible with BJS_co_ you need to use the vertexData object to define your geometry.  You can start with BJS primitives created with vertexData arrays_co_ but you need to keep it there.  Set your primitives updatable as you say_co_  but you will need to add many vertices to (and remove a few from) a standard primitive... in order to accomplish chamfers and fillets_co_ and you will be working with the vertexData_t_s arrays.  If you leave the vertexData

already included in the vertexData arrays of these extended primitives... upon creation.  Using a freehand editor to add/remove vertices and their indices_co_ normals_co_ uvs_co_ colors_co_ etc... is a big challenge.  Selecting which vertices... is everything_co_ and welding gets involved.  Not an easy task_co_ but maybe you_t_re up for the challenge_co_ P8.  I_t_m glad it_t_s you and not me.

Blender?  Is it a wise use of your hours/brains?  In some circles_co_ modeling is ONE thing_co_ scene-layout is ANOTHER thing_co_ and display-in-webGL is a THIRD thing.  Perhaps it is wise to take careful notice of the borders between those three activities.  Perhaps target your projects toward any ONE of those areas_co_ but don_t_t let your app cross those borders.  If your project has to cross one of those borders_co_ write a DIFFERENT app for each area.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf you think about it_co_ BJS is the third thing.  Blender is handling modeling and scene layout.  Some say that Blender modeling should be separate from Blender scene layout.  It is still a heavily debated issue.   But notice that BJS can import mesh models_co_ and/or scene layouts.  We get both... from the other side of the border.  Our geometry-generation system is really an add-on to BJS_co_ correct?  It is a modeling task_co_ not a webGL displaying task.  The BJS editors... are really scene-layout devices_co_ not modelers. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn short (too late for that)... if you want modeling_co_ write a modeler.  If you want scene layout_co_ write a scene assembler.  If you want webGL displaying and lots of fun effects_co_ use BJS.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_

assembly tools. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_qt_Powered-by-BJS_qt_ is _lt_u_gt_not_lt_/u_gt_ the right approach.  Powered-by-JS is.  BJS is JUST _lt_u_gt_one_lt_/u_gt_ of the _qt_modules_qt_ that your powered-by-JS will use.  Not overloaded_co_ not modified.  It needs to stay as it is_co_ and you need to talk to it using its _lt_u_gt_normal unmodified interface_lt_/u_gt_.  That way_co_ you can easily snap-on new versions of BJS as it evolves_co_ and due to your _qt_powered-by-JS_qt_ project ALWAYS following that interface STRICTLY... it_t_s an easy update.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tJust
