I_t_ve been evaluating Babylon (and others) as I prep for an updated edition. The book first came out at the end of 2013 when Three.js was pretty much the only game in town. It_t_s fun seeing what_t_s available in 2017. And Babylon is among my happy discoveries.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat said_co_ I_t_ve got some questions / feedback -- and am especially curious if others use Babylon to teach. _lt_strong_gt_I totally get that Babylon isn_t_t a teaching library._lt_/strong_gt_ So feel free to ignore some / all of this..\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFirst up_co_ I really appreciate the beauty of the resulting animations that I get with Babylon. Even with simple shapes (e.g. those in an intro chapter)_co_ things are pretty and don_t_t require much fiddling with lights and cameras. The various support handlers (resizing) are unobtrusive and work solidly. And the integrated physics is a joy. I seriously love working with that stuff. That said...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe API kinda bugs me (and I say that with due love!)...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne of the things that I try to do in the book is keep the typing to a minimum. It_t_s aimed at kids -- motivated kids -- but kids nonetheless. The more typing_co_ the higher the likelihood of errors. The more that code requires switching between all caps_co_ and camelcase_co_ the more likelihood of coding errors. The more namespace depth_co_ the higher the likelihood of errors. The same goes for the number of arguments in constructors and methods. As well as the different _lt_em_gt_kinds_lt_/em_gt_ of arguments (strings_co_ numbers_co_ objects_co_ and attribute objects -- curly braces can be daunting!). \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn addition to a lot of typing_co_ needing to label every mesh and supply every mesh with a scene object is burdensome without providing much conceptual relevancy. That is_co_ I have to teach kids / adults to include them all the time even though names aren_t_t used much -- at least not when introducing concepts. Mostly_co_ I wonder why createSphere can_t_t auto-assign the name _qt_sphereN_qt_ when the first argument isn_t_t a string. My understanding is that the scene argument helps with memory management_co_ which is cool -- it seems to work. That said_co_ I wouldn_t_t mind the option of being able to tell the scene to add a mesh instead of creating a mesh for the scene. And really_co_ I_t_d like fewer arguments for my own sanity in addition to teaching.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo I_t_m curious if anyone deals with teaching or has suggestions for how to deal with these things. I_t_ve thought about writing a simple wrapper that flattens some of the namespace_co_ auto-assigns a label_co_ and simplifies the MeshBuilder create methods. Maybe something that creates a sphere even when no arguments are supplied_co_ creates a sphere with diameter when the first argument is a number_co_ or creates a sphere with named attributes when the last argument is an object literal. But of course_co_ that_t_s work for me (shudder). Plus the older kids / adults that want to start _qt_real_qt_ Babylon coding will be at a disadvantage.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlong those lines_co_ I understand why MeshBuilder creates the shape and material at the same time. Still_co_ I appreciate Threejs_t_ separation when teaching -- create a geometry_co_ create a material_co_ create a mesh by combining the two. I understand that Babylon is meant for professionals to be productive_co_ but it_t_d be super nice to have access to low-level concepts for teaching (and maybe coding at times).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt_t_d also be nice to have a set() method on Vector3 to be able to update all three at the same time instead of using the _qt_inPlace_qt_ methods.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne last thing is the left-handed coordinate system. Kids just aren_t_t exposed to that in my experience. I_t_m grateful for the useRightHandedSystem property even if it_t_d be preferable not to expose it at all. I would only suggest that it_t_s not explicit and easy to overlook for folks first coming to Babylon.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyhow_co_ thanks for the great framework. Really! Despite the above_co_ I definitely anticipate using it -- even if not in the book.

I_t_ve found a browser-based editor that I control to be a decent (but by no means perfect) longer-term solution. I also favor typing everything out when you_t_re first learning it. Partly because that_t_s how I did it as a kid. But mostly I think it gives kids more a sense of personal ownership of code when they -- not their tools -- write it out. All that said_co_ I_t_ll dig into Visual Studio as a possible companion / intermediate course (as _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/22801-inteja/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_22801_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/22801-inteja/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@inteja_lt_/a_gt_ suggests)  -- I _lt_em_gt_definitely_lt_/em_gt_ see the benefit there.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe scene thing isn_t_t a huge deal.

As a retired teacher I am still interested in how you get concepts over to people. In trying to help BabylonJS noobs I have expanded on some of the official documentation through a _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//babylonjsguide.github.io/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_guide_lt_/a_gt_. When I go back and read some pages of the guide I still see the need for improvement. So I know how difficult it can be to write explanations. But enough of my credentials and back to my thoughts.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhen I first came to BabylonJS I misunderstood quite a bit as my brain was thinking my way and misinterpreted what was in the tutorials rather than reading them thoroughly. Over time and with lots of help from people on the forum my understanding developed. What I am trying to say is that when you first came across Three either it straight away fitted your thinking or in using it you have developed a way of thinking about how to code in 3D. When you re-write the book using BabylonJS then your _t_how to code 3D_t_ and _t_applying the underlying concepts_t_ will need to change_co_ albeit slightly\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor example parts of the first chapter could become\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Creating Spheres_lt_/strong_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tBalls are always called spheres in geometry and in 3D programming.
