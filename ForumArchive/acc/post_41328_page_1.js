The resolution defines the number of subdiv you would like to have on the sphere. The bigger the better but the slower as usual _lt_span class_eq__qt_ipsEmoji_qt__gt_ðŸ™‚_lt_/span_gt_Â I guess it defaults to 32 which has been proven a niceÂ middleground value.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNone of them relates to the size of the picture_co_ only the geometry created to display the dome.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
