I basically have a blender file which I try to export with animation to Babylon.js._lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tFirst I made the mesh animate in Blender which doesn_t_t work since I use need skeletons to animate. Then I created an armature with a bone and redid all the animations. Now I binded the object/mesh to the bone and the animation looks well and all in Blender. Even when I export the .babylon file I see the `skeletons_dd_ []` being defined in the file. But upon importing there are no skeletons included. The connection between the mesh and skeleton is through _qt_childOf_dd_ skeleton_qt_ which might not be ideal. However the only other solution I_t_ve found that might work is putting bones everywhere with automated weight and hope that all meshes gets moved in the animation_sm_ which they don_t_t. I_t_ve also done Bake Action prior to exporting. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI simply wish to get the animation from Blender into Babylon.js.
