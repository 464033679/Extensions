When I import_co_ I dispose of an existing OBJ and MTL_co_ and declare their variable (array) as null. But my frame rate continues to drop as I add and dispose of objects - even though there is only 20 heads at a time in the scene - never more. But my fps drops from over 40fps to under 20fps once I add less than 10 new heads and dispose of an equal amount.

But_co_ right now there_t_s allot I can try and optimize the scene and overall architecture in the process. Thanks for looking at this_co_ as I know how busy you and your team are. And I guarantee you_t_ll be impressed with what we_t_re building_co_ as it_t_s something not yet seen in WebGL - and pushes Babylon.js to the limit. It has also received such a great response from the executive team in Japan_co_ America_co_ and internationally - that they have concrete plans to take the _qt_game_qt_ onto stages internationally for highlighting the hardware abilities of the new super secret Sony phones and features which they alone contain. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSony is extremely happy with the Babylon.js framework_co_ and appreciate all of your personal interest in the project and the support available to us as well as the entire Babylon.js user community. I_t_ll be trying to get you or someone from your team here soon_co_ as Sony realizes the dramatic potential which BJS provides us now and continuing to provide in the future. The general quality of rendering_co_ animation_co_ and all aesthetic and subjective elements of the content is far greater than what was ever initially imagined in our (Sony_t_s) initial discussions concerning which framework to use on both the projected content as well as any mobile content. But I_t_ll provide you with more info on this as soon as I_t_m able to do so - since our project and the release of the new hardware is extremely _qt_hush hush_qt_ - as might be expected in such a highly competitive market. However_co_ I can tell you that what is coming is a bit _qt_mind-blowing_qt_ in many ways.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut again_co_ thank you for building such a well thought out and well functioning framework_sm_ and providing a level of support which is unprecedented in the open source community.
