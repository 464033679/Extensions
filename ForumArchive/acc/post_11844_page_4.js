Each playground demo that was associated with each step of the playpen tutorials... needed to be very clear and ONLY show THAT step.  In other words_co_ we couldn_t_t have a playground near the end of the playpen series... that showed sprites_co_ particles_co_ materials_co_ basic/advanced shapes_co_ fog_co_ skyboxes_co_ etc... all in the same scene.  It got too cluttered._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So_co_ about that time_co_ I made an audacious command decision.... to phase-out the step-by-step sequential format of the playpen tutorials.  I used The Babylon Primer as the step-by-step to get a basic scene activated (as best I could)_co_ and I evolved the playpen series into a non-sequential thing.  The Primer replaced playpen docs 1 and 2_co_ which likely nobody remembers.  Then I started with playpen #3... renumbered_co_ and matched those numbers to playground demo numbers.  You will still notice a few _qt_now your scene is looking great...blah blah blah_qt_... residuals from the sequential step-by-step days._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_All of a sudden (actually only about 5/8 of a sudden)... the definition of _qt_tutorial_qt_ was in question_co_ at least in MY mind.  A TRUE tutorial_co_ in my opinion_co_ is ALWAYS a talk-through_co_ and therefore a TOC is inappropriate.  A TOC would allow people to enter these talk-throughs at middle points... ruining the _qt_talk-through/walk-through_qt_ sequence._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But then_co_ _qt_tutorials_qt_ like Cameras came along.   With 8-10 cameras covered in that document... it sure couldn_t_t be in _qt_talk-through_qt_ format any more_co_ if it ever was.  The Cameras tutorial/documentation seemed to say goodbye to being a true tutorial_co_ and became a _qt_documentation_qt_ or whatever you want to call a non-tutorial teaching file.  It became a _qt_Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Cameras_qt_.  I think it is useful in its current format_co_ but_co_ it_t_s not really a tutorial_co_ and it_t_s also not _qt_Everything About Cameras_qt_.  IF we included everything about cameras_co_ then the document would get much

(imho)_co_ and long ago outdated.  _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But_co_ it IS easier for a _qt_many editors_qt_ system like our BabylonDoc system.  If we allowed many folks to edit our potential future XML and XSL tutorials_co_ I think we_t_d have messes... but maybe we would come to each others_t_ rescue to repair them.  With XSL_co_ we can let users choose the filtering levels.... by letting them choose different XSL stylesheets to apply against the XML_co_ or even letting users write and store their own XSL stylesheets... and have personalized document filtering... including rendering the document to look like a Table Of Contents (TOC).  And_co_ with styled XML_co_ we get anchor points... for TOC_t_s.  Conversely_co_ I_t_m not sure if .md allows anchors at all._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In my opinion_co_ Scene and Mesh API docs... need TOC_t_s more than any other docs we have.  It takes me forever to find something I need on Scene_co_ and when I get there_co_ I get VERY SPARSE info from the .ts files... rarely any help whatsoever.  I usually need to go to the Scene source code at GitHub_co_ and try to determine what a Scene property/method really does... via analyzing the code.  That_t_s not good._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Ahh_co_ SO much to think about.  Lots of opinions and ideas.  How do we know what_t_s right and what_t_s not so right?  Should we start by putting strict regimentation on the terminology?  Should our _qt_tutorials_qt_ follow the strict definition of a _qt_tutorial_qt_?  Do we care about that?  I once mentioned it to Temechon_co_ too_co_ when trying to determine if _qt_tutorials_qt_ should have one type of icon_co_ and _qt_documentation_qt_ another type... etc.  In other words... for Temechon and BD programmers_co_ should tutorials be ONE type of PHP class_co_ and documentation be another type_co_ and API doc be a third type?  Should we try to strictly conform to our document types?  Do we try to teach our curators and editors how to avoid adding things to tutorials... which don_t_t follow the _qt_rules of being a tutorial_qt_?  Why do I start feeling Gestapo_co_

It_t_s easy to tell when you see the BJS docs that they have been steadily growing and expanding along with the framework. As a contributor of a few lines here and there in the doc_co_ I can tell that I had a hard time finding the right place to document features about 75% of the time. I_t_d say (probably an uneducated guess) that one day or another the whole structure of the documentation will have to be rethinked_co_ and files will have to be merged/splitted accordingly (tutorials on one side_co_ helping building a simple scene step by step_co_ and documentation/advanced features articles on the other side). Maybe that_t_s already happening behind the scenes for BabylonDoc 2.0?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Also_co_ 100% agreed on having to look into the source to know what a property does. I for one don_t_t use the API pages in the documentation as the source code is very readable_co_ especially TS files.
