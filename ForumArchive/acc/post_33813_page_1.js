I just wanted to point out a couple of issues which I have found to become personal references in building UIs over the past few years. Firstly_co_ I don_t_t recommend image based color pickers_co_ as these can be difficult to manage in varying OS_t__co_ devices_co_ and browsers. I personally prefer color pickers which are exclusively JavaScript based_sm_ as this affords me far greater flexibility.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ I was building all of my UIs using WebGL (babylon.js specifically)_co_ and stopped this practice as I had many issues with maintenance of the UIs over time. Instead_co_ I build all GUIs using native HTML5_co_ CSS_co_ and non-WebGL JavaScript_co_ as again_co_ I find far greater flexibility and far less problems as outside of rendering meshes_co_ I can create GUI elements with greater functionality which natively run on every device_co_ OS_co_ and browser. Whereas using WebGL_co_ I was constantly battling all three of these elements and would quite often find my GUIs wouldwork in one version of BJS on most every device_co_ yet stop functioning on some devices_co_ OS_co_ and browsers upon the next release of BJS_co_ and/or browser updates - as there are still so many variables in the functionality of WebGL for devices and browsers - as WebGL is still a young standard comparatively.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs is obvious by reading my posts_co_ I love babylon.js. However_co_ I have lost many hours trying to make BJS the one framework to do EVERYTHING_sm_ and this has cost me allot of time and resources as well as limiting my ability to create tools and styles which are often quite simple to create in HTML_co_ CSS_co_ and JavaScript. I_t_ve mentioned this before_co_ and am posting again_co_ as I find that the current mindset appears to be to make babylon.js do everything in building content_co_ games_co_ and rich user experiences - excluding most of the basic tools which already exist and do many of these functions better. So I just wanted to point out that I personally am able to develop rich content and applications much faster when working with WebGL as an element among many others in developing on the web. Whereas for over one year_co_ I took the path of developing most everything strictly within WebGL_co_ and excluding many of the proven tools which are far more compatible acros multiple devices and browsers_co_ and require far less maintenance in the long run - and often the short run as well.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPlease don_t_t get me wrong_co_ as I_t_m a true believer in WebGL and specifically babylon.js. However_co_ I find that many of the questions on this forum and questions I used to ask could be solved far easier by working outside of WebGL_co_ and using WebGL for what it is best for - in rendering meshes and animation_co_ and shading rich environments and objects which rival many of the best OpenGL games on the market these days. This is simply my personal observance and experience_co_ and I_t_m far less of a fan of building GUIs using WebGL these days than I used to be. For me_co_ it_t_s all about keeping my options open. And FYI - I_t_m not suggesting that you are not considering all options and simply exploring WebGL GUI elements. Your post simply provided me the opportunity to make this point. And by the way - nice work on the GUI elements.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jaredm","Date":"2017-11-06T00:33:36Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt_ - I appreciate you sharing your experience.  We_t_re building tool to visualise application source code and data models so it_t_s not quite a game _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn this case_co_ we have to label a bunch of elements with some basic text.  I already understand how trying to re-invent everything in WebGL could be painful so we_t_re only displaying the minimal amount of textual information in WebGL itself and for everything else we have an HTML div that we overlay on mouse clicks/hovers.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"aanaa","Date":"2018-06-15T11:25:31Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\thi _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/29098-jaredm/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_29098_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/29098-jaredm/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@jaredm_lt_/a_gt_  I happen to have stumbled across this post to solve the same problem_co_ and I_t_m also prototyping a source visualisation!
