Since I plan on making a mobile game_co_ I_t_m concerned complex models on top of intricate animations will ruin my project. I understand how 3D video animation works in regards to rendering the animation (taking hundreds of thousands of pictures) but how does this work in games? Does everything that moves pre-rendered and just played upon certain triggers or does the cpu/gpu calculate/manipulate meshes on certain triggers? Sorry if this doesn_t_t make sense but I have the feeling I_t_m going to end up with a bunch of animation files for each model_co_ for each type of movement and depending on how large these files are_co_ may render a mobile game I want to make impossible. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JohnK","Date":"2017-01-26T09:43:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi and welcome from me.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHere is a game made with BabylonJS _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//cdn.babylonjs.com/wwwbabylonjs/Scenes/prosecution/index.html_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//cdn.babylonjs.com/wwwbabylonjs/Scenes/prosecution/index.html_lt_/a_gt_ a lot going on and plays well.

In this case scene frame 600 may be rendered at a time greater than 10 seconds. It is possible to use scene.registerBeforeRender and scene.registerAfterRender as an alternative to using animation objects. Simple example _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//babylonjsguide.github.io/gamelets/Car_Path_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//babylonjsguide.github.io/gamelets/Car_Path_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnimation frames are given a frame rate in frames per second and the BabylonJS engine draws the appropriate animation frame at the appropriate time. So if you give an animation a animation frame rate of 25 then after 500 seconds animation frame 20 will be draw during the correct scene frame rendering.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo there are different ways of tackling animation within BJS and with care and careful planning and design much can be realised.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTry out some ideas_co_ modify other_t_s work and most of all happy learning and game development.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
