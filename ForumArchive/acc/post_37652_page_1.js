Anything that gets added to the world needs to be able to be part of collisions against a couple hundred entities each frame. The heightmap is super high performance intrinsically and has no problem. moveWithCollisions is okay too so far_co_ but I only have a few objects in the game total... but I_t_m imagining that if this ever becomes too expensive I can use the octree in babylon or roll my own spatial structure.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNow I_t_d like to begin putting structures into this world that the player can walk through. These houses are going to have doorways_co_ windows_co_ and staircases. I_t_d like the player to be able to move through the doorways and larger windows_co_ as well as *up* the staircases.
