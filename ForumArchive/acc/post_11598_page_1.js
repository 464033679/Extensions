Depending of where the camera is_co_ I create new GroudMeshes as needed and tile it on the terrain. My Tiles are a json object with altitude data and some other values._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I am facing a problem after loading the grounds. I cannot see any error and the grounds are loaded but they are _qt_not visible_qt_ and depending of the angle of the camera they appear in the scene and disappear. They should also be checking collisions but they are not._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I have a running example of my system_co_ for simplicity I am always loading the same json but the control of the tiles and the rest are the same. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63244599/CollisionsAndVisibility/CollisionsAndVisibility.html_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63244599/CollisionsAndVisibility/CollisionsAndVisibility.html_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_To see the problem just click on the link after loading try to move the camera arround (keep the same position) looking in a 20 degree down aprox. and You will see the ground_co_ if you are lucky _dd_S_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_According with my testing_co_ it seems to be something related with loading the meshes during the _qt_before render_qt_ or _qt_render_qt_ events.
