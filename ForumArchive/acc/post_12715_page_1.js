I am confused about deployment and how to actually release the game_co_ so I would appreciate if you would solve a couple of mysteries I have about this._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_First of all_co_ I can see that I need a _lt_strong_gt_webserver_lt_/strong_gt_ in order to use Babylon properly. I understand that this is because I need to define a custom MIME type for the .babylon extension to be loadable. Alright_co_ so basically_co_ all I need to do is use the js framework to craft my own game by implementing game mechanics and importing files from Blender with the .babylon extension_co_ all of this running on my Apache local webserver?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_If so_co_ then how can I redistribute the game? I will make users download the games files (js scripts_co_ .babylon files_co_ css files and actual html files that link everything) but how can I be sure that the user will actually have a webserver installed? What if they don_t_t? Because my point is to make the game work offline_co_ not in such a way that the users will need to access my website everytime they want to play the game._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And then I thought about Node.js. Do you guys think I can include node.js along with the game files? I mean_co_ will that create a node local server on every user_t_s machine when they download the files_co_ so the game will be ran on that node.js server just as it runs on my own local server on my machine? How can I do that? Is this what I_t_m supposed to do?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Or_co_ perhaps_co_ this is totally wrong and I should simply host the game files on my online server and only allow users to play online?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Thank you!_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jahow","Date":"2015-02-24T13:56:17Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hosting your game on an online server is the simplest way to go.
