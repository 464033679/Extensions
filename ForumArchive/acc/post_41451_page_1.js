At the end of the round the game client could submit this long list of moves to the server_co_ and the server could re-simulate the same game and generate the player_t_s score. The player could still be a hacker submitting fraudulent moves_co_ so the server would still have to validate some things... but this provides a basis for knowing whether submitted information is potentially valid whereas receiving a json message like { playerId_dd_ 219_co_ score_dd_ 9999999 } leaves very little toÂ validate.
