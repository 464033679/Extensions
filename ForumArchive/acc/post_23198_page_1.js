Maybe it has something to do with the manifest file....is there a way I can overwrite the pathway to that asset rather than it trying to find it in the same place as the .babylon file or set it to not look for it at all?(I know iOS and desktop Safari have issues with cookies being sent from an iframe I_t_d imagine this is the same issue) \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"FbFGlobal_Dev","Date":"2016-08-02T19:28:03Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHey Gang!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have an update on this! So I did a couple things while experimenting to get this working. First I made the switch to Babylon v2.4_co_ then switched from hand.js to PEP. This would now render the frame on iOS browsers (so that was a start) but I would not have camera controls (no errors would come up either). Then I looked at how the scene was built. Originally_co_ I just loaded the entire scene with BABYLON.SceneLoader.Load() and added a light and arcRotateCamera (again this worked great for desktop and android but those darn Apple products weren_t_t too happy). Anywho I opted to build the scene out manually and just imported my meshes and rigs via BABYLON.SceneLoader.ImportMesh(). Once doing that_co_ my scene now renders and I have full camera controls on iOS_co_ Android and desktop! \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt would seem that_co_ in this user case_co_ SceneLoader.Load() doesn_t_t like to be in an iFrame.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI did run into another snag though on iOS.
