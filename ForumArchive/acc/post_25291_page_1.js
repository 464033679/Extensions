However_co_ I am spending a lot of time in non-related stuff of the framework_co_ that is converting fbx files into babylon files.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat I try to do is to load this pack into a babylon project _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/69687_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/69687_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have followed other topics regarding to install a plugin in blender and exporting to babylon. I have managed to load the model.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThen I do the same process with the 4 animations_co_ to export them_co_ and I edit the babylon json file_co_ and I move manualy the skeleton array into the basic model babylon file. When I play the animation it is distorted. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have also seen other threads using a visual studio project or exec files to merge the fbx files and then export them_co_ but I am running in a mac_co_ not windows.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIs there a way to make run that asset_co_ with the 4 animations? like any reliable online converter or any js addon to load directly fbx.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have seen some threats also that were talking about loading the mesh in a file and the animations in other files_co_ but I didn_t_t manage neither with the distorted animations_co_ I always had to copy manually to the file where is the mesh. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am getting a bit discouraged to continue with this framework (although it looks awesome) in the sense that I spend too much time in non coding related stuff like this_co_ and also that most asset sources are fbx format_co_ and seems hard to have to go through all this process every time with not much warranty that the output will be right and not broken... _dd_/\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks a lot for your time! _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dbawel","Date":"2016-09-20T01:13:41Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tRemember that the FBX format is a Z axis up on export. This will not work well with some animation_co_ so I highly recommend that you view your FBX file in the free FBX coverter/viewer first_co_ and if the orientation is correct_co_ then import the FBX file into Blender. There you can take advantage of the exporter to the .babylon format which in my opinion_co_ is the best pipeline to BJS. The other advantage to FBX is that as an ascii format_co_ it_t_s easy to read and edit - provided you_t_re exporting an ascii FBX file.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs for the babylon.js framework_co_ I_t_ve spent almost 3 years working in WebGL_co_ and can do far more in less time with few restictions.
