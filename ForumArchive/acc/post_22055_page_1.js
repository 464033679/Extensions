amount of difference).  You will need to STOP your moving ring... at the edges of your new shrunken canvas.  This may be a challenge. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd you might wish to change them to digital joysticks.  Then your moving ring will not need to travel much distance.  The user needs ANY indication that they are dragging forward/backward_co_ etc... but it need not use tons of screen space.  The distance between the moving ring and the stationary ring is not used... for a digital joystick.  Digital joysticks just use switches_co_ and not potentiometers/pots.  The AMOUNT of distance is not important for digital joysticks.  In fact_co_ if you convert to digital joystick (switches only_co_ ring-to-ring distance unused)_co_ then you might want to change the shapes drawn on the screen... to something more akin to rocker switches.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWay more information than you really wanted_co_ eh?  I just wanted to show you that... YOU could start hacking on the VJ_t_s yourself.  If you invent something wonderful_co_ we would ALL like to see it and hear about it_co_ if you please.  Feel free to ask more questions_co_ of course.  Davrous is truly the God of VJ_co_ but the rest of us are gradually learning how to do mad scientist experiments with his magical devices.  Davrous is a pretty busy guy_co_ and if he IS planning _qt_VJ2 - The Legend Continues_qt_... it might be ONLY in the planning stages_co_ and he might have 50 projects ahead of him with higher priorities... who knows.  The guy hardly ever comes to _qt_chew the rag_qt_ (visit and talk a lot) with us.  I think he_t_s shy.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Good coder and darned smart_co_ though.  He_t_s one of the BJS founders and elders.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPersonally_co_ I dislike adding another canvas to the DOM tree when a VJ activates.  I like absolutely-positioned HTML elements/buttons_co_ myself.  But_co_ rumor has it that DOM elements (HTML elements) are difficult to get access-to... on Android-ish devices.  I have no experience with that...
