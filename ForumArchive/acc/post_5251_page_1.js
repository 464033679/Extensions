Nevertheless_co_ your files will still appear in the Network panel of your browser and anyone will be able to get the content of them. Your files should then be encrypted but it means you need something to unencrypt them for babylonJS. You don_t_t have a lot of options for that_co_ you need to write something in javascript to unencrypt them and your code must be ofuscated since otherwise it would be too easy to know how to unecrypt your files. BUT still it will be really easy to add a breakpoint in the parsing code of babylonJS to get the unencrypted content of your files... or just serialize the loaded scene to get the unencrypted version._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_All of this can be resumed to _qt_sorry guys but not sure it will be possible to protect your files_qt_.

You_t_re only option is to obfuscate / encrypt_co_ but that will not protect anything from those that seriously want it.

A silly javascript obfuscation would be nothing more than an anoyance to someone that knew what they were doing. We were one of the first groups to crack Thermidia almost 8 years ago._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Not trying to disuade you from using HTML5 etc_co_ but it is what it is. For what reason do you feel that it_t_s necessary to go through that much effort to protect something that_t_s opensource to begin with? I_t_ve come to accept the fact that trying to keep people out is just a waste of time and money. Time better spent developing. It_t_s really disheartning the first time you realize just how fast someone can rip off your work_co_ even if you_t_re doing everything possible to lock it down. You_t_re best bet is to hire an lawyer and protect your copyrights. Of course_co_ again_co_ it_t_s opensource software_co_ so that_t_s easier said than done._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Good luck with your project!
