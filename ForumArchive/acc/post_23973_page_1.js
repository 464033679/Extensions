I would like to be able to get to a point where I can code something like this and know why it works how it works. I died a bit of  research into getVerticesData and was able to do basic editing of terrain(say for example in for loop_co_ divide position value by 3 etc_co_ and reapply to height map).

correct (for Oimo).  For CannonJS_co_ which BJS also interfaces-with_co_ there is a meshImposter_co_ and it may need re-creating as you subdivide ground tiles.  But maybe this is the wrong approach.  A mesh can be setEnabled true/false.  So you might want to consider _qt_mining mode_qt_ where you essentially turn off the rest of the terrain and maybe ONLY display the mining area_co_ with no physics.   But maybe you want mining trucks/vehicles that lose their footing as they are driving up the sides of the mine pit_co_ and tumble to the bottom.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_

change the scene from world mode_co_ to mining mode.  Then you don_t_t need to subdivide the original terrain.  You just replace world terrain (lower rez) with mining terrain (hi rez)... when the user enters mining mode at a certain spot.  In mining mode_co_ you will need to figure a way to avoid letting the user see far distances... so they don_t_t see the now-missing world-sized terrain.  We have fog and we have camera maximum z setting to keep them from seeing too far.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe rest of your comments are almost correct and well-thought.  Indices are actually the lines connecting three vertices of all triangular mesh faces.  I think they are also called _qt_strides_qt__co_ sometimes.  Anyway_co_ lets say you plot 3 vertices in space_co_ preparing to make a triangle face of a mesh.  Connecting the vertices clockwise or counter-clockwise... determines which side of the new face... is front face_co_ and which is back face.  The indices connecting-order determines which way the lighting normals are facing (_lt_em_gt_I think)_lt_/em_gt_.   Usually normals are straight up or straight down_co_ but exceptions are common. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFlat-shaded mesh are somewhat different_co_ often having multiple vertices at a single point in space_co_ and thus having multiple normals_co_ each aiming different.  (But only one normal allowed per vertex.  Flat shading often uses multiple vertex at the same location_co_ and that is how the multiple normals at a single vertex point location... is accomplished.)  (_lt_em_gt_I think)_lt_/em_gt_  _lt_img

Do a forum search.  It_t_s not a well-documented system_co_ because Naz... is a friggin_t_ genius_co_ and he lives on a different astral plane than most others.  Naz (NasimiAsl) is in Tehran_co_ which is bigtime cool all by itself.   But also_co_ he is just a GOD of _qt_GPU_qt_.  He can make ANYTHING run in the GPU... and that means fast_co_ fast_co_ fast_co_ and... it_t_s almost like a forked process or worker thread.  Essentially_co_ it happens in the background_co_ and allows the JS (your project) which runs on the CPU side... full speeds and perhaps reduced terrain-updating

pursue fervently.  The things Naz does... they_t_re amazing.... and they are amazingly weird-coded for most of us.  But still... want to do Catmull calc_t_s and subdiving at blazing speeds?  I think it might be wise to take a close look at how Naz does this dynamic terrain.  It might also help if you speak Persian.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_
