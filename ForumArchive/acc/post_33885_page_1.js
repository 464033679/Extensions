I have problem with scenario attack player and monsters movements. I using socket IO.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhen player moving monster attack area intersection is checking on client side_co_ so i think is not secure_co_ because user can block this event. Then monster newer go to player location and don_t_t attack him. Next problem is attack of player_co_ when player attack collision is check on client side - it can be verify on server_co_ which monsters you can attack on actual player position and how many times you can attack in some time.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo i have some questions.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat you think about create monster server - socket io client_co_ which connect with socket io server of game_co_ which get player and monsters positions. On monster server I run BABYLON engine with simple boxes_co_ which reconstruct real scene - then monster will attack and moving using serer side. What do you think about this?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat with attacks? It should be verify on monster server or simple calculations of positions (players and monsters)?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMaybe do you have other idea to do that.
