For instance_co_ does it have Ping Pong_co_ (back and forth animation)  or any other type? If there is can anyone help me understand how to implement it? Because so far I am only calling the beginAnimation function and I have set the loop to true. The thing is that the character animation is not  seamless and there is a noticeable _qt_glitch_qt_ between the end frame and the start frame. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I had this same problem in Unity and the ping pong animation fixed that and it gave me a seamless animation.
