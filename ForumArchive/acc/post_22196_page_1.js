I want to be able to use a camTo function to move the player around the scene. I have a position v3 and target v3. If I do not have a rotation value_co_ the camera is not looking at the target. Is there a way to calculate the rotation knowing the position of the camera and the position of the target. Is my approach to this incorrect? How do I correctly move my freecamera to the correct location and ensure that it is looking at my desired target?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2016-04-27T14:19:21Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThere are ways to do this without caring about all that.  Either use a followCamera (third person camera)_co_ or a subclass of TargetCamera (practically all but ArcRotateCamera) &amp_sm_ set the target.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThere is some trigonometry to assign rotation to camera_co_ but I do not understand why you would move your camera to the _qt_correct_qt_ location.  If it is a first person camera_co_ the user has already moved it to where they want to view from.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"DezOnlyOne","Date":"2016-04-27T15:09:06Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_126462_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_22196_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1461766761_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_JCPalmer_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t47 minutes ago_co_ JCPalmer said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tThere are ways to do this without caring about all that.  Either use a followCamera (third person camera)_co_ or a subclass of TargetCamera (practically all but ArcRotateCamera) &amp_sm_ set the target.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tThere is some trigonometry to assign rotation to camera_co_ but I do not understand why you would move your camera to the _qt_correct_qt_ location.  If it is a first person camera_co_ the user has already moved it to where they want to view from.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSorry_co_ I can explain further.
