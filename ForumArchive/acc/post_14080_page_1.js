 You were able to aquire some of the best advice from professionals on this site - in asking the most important question as a game developer_sm_ and hopefully you received your answer all within 24 hours.  What a great community of developers!  If you are truly moving forward with this_co_ I hope you take the advice from jerome and use BabylonJS to build the first prototype of your game.  If you set you sights on this goal first_co_ then when you complete your game design for the full RTS game_co_ you can begin fresh knowing exactly what you are up against_co_ and how to move forward.  And of course_co_ you_t_ll have some code already written in which to use_co_ improve_co_ and build upon.  This will accellerate your entire process_co_ and in sharing your simple game prototype with the BabylonJS community will allow you to learn the framework quickly_co_ as we_t_re all learning and building together._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I guess we_t_ll be seeing you around.  Look forward to playing your first game demo._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2015-04-26T22:11:16Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hey DB_dd_)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_do you know what were the reason why _qt__lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(40_co_40_co_40)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm__qt__gt_a game developer who regretted choosing BabylonJS_qt_ ?_lt_/span_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dbawel","Date":"2015-04-26T23:47:18Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hey DK_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Please re-read what I wrote.  I think you read it as if I know developers who have regretted choosing BabylonJS.  On the contrary_co_ I have never met any developer who regretted choosing BabylonJS over ThreeJS_co_ but several who wished they had chosen BabylonJS instead of ThreeJS to build their content._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Here_t_s what I wrote _dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt__gt__lt_div_gt_As Jerome mentioned_co_ he ported what he was building in ThreeJS to BabylonJS and never regretted doing so.  I_t_m much less a fan of ThreeJS_co_ however_co_ I_t_ve yet to meet a game developer who regretted choosing BabylonJS over ThreeJS - but have known several who regretted choosing ThreeJS and not BabylonJS.  So there it is._lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/blockquote_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I think I understand what you_t_re asking_co_ and hope this clears up any confusion as to my point.  I also personally began testing using ThreeJS as it was recommended to me by a friend and developer.  However_co_ as there appeared to be only two primary frameworks for developing 3D content in HTML5_co_ I wanted to understand developing using BabylonJS in comparison.  And once I began using BabylonJS_co_ I never went back to ThreeJS and my company now only uses BabylonJS for developing content delivery on the web.  As of now_co_ we_t_re primarily developing for the support of HTML5 using our existing adaptive multi-user streaming server_co_ and will soon begin to update our graphic authoring tools in support of our server technology_sm_ so as soon as we have the resources available_co_ we will be supporting the BabylonJS framework in our authoring tools as well.  We haven_t_t had the bandwidth internally to develop and publish anything worth viewing within BabylonJS to the web yet_co_ but you_t_ll soon see some of the work we_t_re doing_sm_ and we look forward to helping advance the BabylonJS framework.  I also look forward to sharing the work we_t_ve designed in BabylonJS to the dev community_co_ as server development is not what I personally find most interesting - but certainly necessary._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Please let me know if I answered your question.  Otherwise_co_ please re-phrase if I mis-understood.  Again_co_ perhaps I didn_t_t write clearly enough to make my point_co_ and if this is the case_co_ I_t_ll want to edit the post to make certain that it is clearly understood what I meant._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"elessar.perm","Date":"2015-04-27T05:36:22Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Thank you guys!
