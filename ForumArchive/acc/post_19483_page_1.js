The newest version just added cylinders_co_ which I will add pretty soon (once the new version is stable). The way the heightmap is implemented in OimoJS is using a lot of spheres and boxes that simulate a heightmap. This is wonderful for certain surfaces_co_ but very problematic for very complex surfaces. You can see in the demo_co_ that some spheres are _qt_stuck_qt_ where you would expect them to slide down. This is the reason. And this is where Cannon comes to the rescue. Heightmap and Mesh impostors were implemented / improved exactly for that reason. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I remember reading once that you (wingnut) said that you prefer Oimo - I do too (I actually wrote that in part 2 of the MSDN Magazine article) but Cannon is much more advanced - containers_co_ springs (coming soon. very soon _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ )_co_ heightmaps_co_ meshes_co_ planes_co_ a lot of fun. If a very simple-yet-powerful physics engine is needed - Oimo would be my first choice. But if complex meshes are needed_co_ there is no escape from using cannon - which is an amazing physics engine! just a bit different._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2015-12-28T23:24:45Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Thanks Raanan_co_ that_t_s very nice of you to say_co_ and thanks for the words about the physics engines.  We have seen a few comments from users such as _qt_it_t_s all in slow motion_qt_.  Do you think we will see even more comments like those... when we ask more of the engines?   Something tells me that as we activate these less-than-primitive impostors_co_ our speeds will drop_co_ and our users will become discouraged._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I don_t_t know.  I_t_m not at all qualified to speak on these subjects.  Sometimes I think our strife to serve mobile devices... cripples our chances of getting high-speed physics for the average home user.  Sometimes I want to say _qt_to hell with mobile crap_co_ I want fluid dynamics on my desktop_qt__co_ and I_t_m willing to install the Freon coolers and physics-dedicated PC boards to get it.  Why should we have to hold the hand of the hand-helds?  Are the mobile devices actually dragging-down the desktop fun?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_*shrug*  I_t_m not sure where things are going.  Thoughts_co_ anyone?  Be well._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2015-12-29T12:50:48Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Slow motion is probably the physics engine_t_s doing - It would be great to see what exactly is meant here.

I believe that it is possible to get good performance_co_ even when using mesh or heightmap impostors. of course_co_ the best performance will be reaches if only sphers and meshes are used_co_ but this is rather limited._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Oimo and cannon allows us to link meshes together - link a few spheres and boxes together_co_ to simulate a complex mesh. This is always a possibility. I played quite a lot with Oimo and compound objects. Oimo_t_s and Cannon_t_s performance are quite the same. Using compound vs. mesh imposter is all up to the developer. It is a question of mesh complexity (for example_co_ try adding physics to a knotted torus - it is too complex). The developer should implement the minimum needed impostors - this will provide the best performance._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I remember you wrote something about HORSE implementation - I have created a simple HORSE game once (will continue developing it when I have the time _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ ) and have simulated a ring using spheres - this works wonderfully. there was no need for a mesh impostor. But this is a ring. not a complex mesh. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The web has its limitations. after all_co_ we are working in a closed container (the browser) which is the component that communicates with the operating system. native will always be a bit better. a web developer must understand that and live with these constraints. It is constantly getting better. each new version the JS engine is faster and more reliable. And once more and more WebGL games will surface_co_ the browsers_t_ vendors will optimize 3D functionality as well.
