When I say _qt_apps_qt__co_ I mean that we are building applications in WebGL which are loading in browsers using links - not installing any executable. So by _qt_apps_qt__co_ I simply mean applications in WebGL. Our latest _qt_app_qt_ runs from a link which the _qt_app_qt_ provides tools for designers to work with various types of media_co_ and there is nothing to install by _qt_.exe_qt_ - the user simply goes to the link and our _qt_app_qt_ loads and functions the same on every OS_co_ platform_co_ and Browser (almost every browser)_co_ and never having to install anything or to even create any link for any specific device or platform. One link runs on all devices and every display and display resolution.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDK has seen what we_t_ve been building_co_ so I_t_m sure he can vouch that I am not at all interested in building applications outside of WebGL. Sorry I wasn_t_t more clear on my definition of _qt_apps_qt_. I_t_m not quite sure why I was mentioned in this post_co_ since I_t_ve never seen this post before - or comented here_co_ but I know I often speak of _qt_apps._qt_ So I just want to be clear by what I mean when I mention the word _qt_apps._qt_ It_t_s all about links in using WebGL and specifically babylon.js.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
