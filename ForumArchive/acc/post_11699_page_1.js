To save memory I de-activated the test collision property for both of them and created a box called collider. I am using this box as the main collider for both items and placed them inside. I then clicked on the check collision property for the box. The problem is that when I test my scene in babylon sandbox the camera_co_ for whatever reason_co_ gets stuck within the bounding box. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Its as if the collider does not detect the camera collider until the camera has entered the box. Then I cannot leave the bounding box.

I figured out what the problem is. The issue was that the object (in this case_co_ the bounding box) had all of its sides inside out!
