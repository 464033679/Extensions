For a project I am working on I have been tasked to create an interactive 3D PC builder. Basically I have to create a 3D model of a PC which I can drag and drop components into to create the complete PC. So I would start off with a case_co_ then I could drag and drop a motherboard onto it then PSU etc...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat I would like to know is if it_t_s possible to do this using the Babylon framework?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have been creating models using 3ds Max but I_t_m not sure if I can export these models with all PNG materials applied into Babylon and have them display in Chrome. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAny help would be appreciated_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks_co_ Aaron\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2016-07-25T21:44:17Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis seems to be a topic _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ _qt_Can I Do this?_qt_.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYes_co_ you can export models from 3DS_co_ with certain limitations to materials etc_t_. If you use the standard shader_t_s properties you should be fine. you can read about it here - _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/exporters/3DSMax_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/exporters/3DSMax_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYes_co_ you can implement drag and drop_co_ but this is not in the scope of Babylon. You will have to handle the native js events. Having said that_co_ go to the playground and check the drag and drop example there.
