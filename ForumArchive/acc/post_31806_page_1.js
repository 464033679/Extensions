When on any slope that is not &gt_sm_ 45 degree angle_co_ the character seems to be automatically sliding down without moving. When trying to travel up a _lt_u_gt_steep_lt_/u_gt_ _lt_u_gt_slope_lt_/u_gt__co_ the _qt_character_qt_ should slowly slide down as if the _qt_player_qt_ cannot climb the slope at a &gt_sm_ 45 degree angle. The player can slowly climb a 45 degree angle. And can normally climb a &lt_sm_ 45 degree angle. I hope I was clear. If not_co_ I can explain in depth for you more.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank You again! &lt_sm_3\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMythros\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"adam","Date":"2017-07-25T10:02:35Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSounds to me like a physics engine is more than what you need.  You should probably just be moving the players according to the height and normal of the ground.  This might be difficult if you aren_t_t very good at math.  I_t_d start out by looking at the code of one of @jerome_t_s ground mesh demos - the one with lots of agents moving on the surface.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tEdit_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//jerome.bousquie.fr/BJS/demos/getHeightAtCoordinates.html_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//jerome.bousquie.fr/BJS/demos/getHeightAtCoordinates.html_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Raggar","Date":"2017-07-25T10:12:08Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11513-mythros/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11513_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11513-mythros/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Mythros_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou_t_ll have to play with mass_co_ fixedRotation_co_ gravity_co_ friction_co_ restitution and all other contact settings and tweak those to get your desired results.
