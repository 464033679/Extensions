If we could_co_ it would thenÂ be useful to be able to delete / disableÂ them one by one to see their impact on performance. Perhaps even better would be toÂ get their statistics in term of their duration within a frame. Ideally the observers would be grouped by the class/type of objects that hold them. For instance_co_ I have 1000 cubes rotating in my scene_co_ and I would rather get the duration that operation takes for the whole group rather than for every single cube one by one.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t3)That could also be done for callbacks we added to functions such as registerBeforeRender()_sm_Â \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t4) maybe we need a memory profiler_sm_ the browser profiler is nice_co_ but maybe we can get more tailored information from babylonjs itself on what memory we are using_co_ what is cached_co_ etc...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t5) we may need a gizmo for the lights. I understand that _qt_mathematically_qt_ a directional light has no position_co_ but still_co_ it would be nice to see the light on the screen_co_ and be able to rotate it on the screen.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t6) could be nice to we able to change the value of text boxÂ (such as Camera.Speed) by dragging the mouse.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Sebavan","Date":"2018-11-21T00:12:20Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is a nice list and I bet _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_4442_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Deltakosh_lt_/a_gt_Â will be happy to tackle some of those in his new baby after his vacation _lt_span_gt__lt_span class_eq__qt_ipsEmoji_qt__gt_ðŸ™‚_lt_/span_gt__lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
