My solution for these types of problems are to export to the FBX format_co_ or to use the Autodesk FBX converter to convert as well as to view the meshes and animation prior to exporting. Then I generally rely on importing the FBX file into Blender and export a .babylon scene file from Blender - which for me holds the highest compatability for all scene elements providing I import an FBX file which maintains al scene elements. And if you write to an ASCII FBX file format_co_ these are fairly simple to edit manually if you run into any problems you cannot solve in an application_sm_ as well as it is often obvious to find errors in an ASCII FBX file as erors will often display null or infinite values.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope this helps_co_ as _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5292_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5292-dad72/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Dad72_lt_/a_gt_ is correct in saying that these issues are very difficult to identify. However_co_ I generally can find them in reading through the ASCII FBX verson of the scene_co_ providing the scene isn_t_t unreasonably enormous - which in case you generally have much larger issues to deal with.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-05-29T18:48:31Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tTHank you for the file.

However I personally use ASCII FBX files for the main reason that I can manually edit them very easily_co_ as they are simple to read and edit - and I can accomplish processes quicly without the need to open in MB or another application. And I can also batch process many ASCII FBX files with simple scripts to quickly make substantial modifications I_t_m unable to perform in applications as well.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut another primary reason for the difference in file size is that the exporters are written with keeping the file size as low as possible by developers such as _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt__co_ whoc reduces the file size to the lowest common denomonator by operations such as removing leading zeros from float values - at least this was one of the last discussions we had on the forum prior to the last version of the .babylon Blender exporter.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo for me it is a matter of convenience and also compatability_co_ as I use MotionBuilder for almost all character animation and scene optimization.
