In my recent three demos teaching position_co_ rotation_co_ and scaling_co_ I could have made the box be a smart box_co_ self-monitoring which phase of the animation it was in_co_ and each containing

_t_createScene_t_.  This has me thinking (everyone duck).  Your initScene() needs no parameters/args.... perfect for pasting into the playground editor.  But your other functions lie outside of the initScene() function_co_ so if a user DID want to paste your code into our playground_co_ they would need to paste-in more than just initScene().  (they would need to paste-in the tag-along
