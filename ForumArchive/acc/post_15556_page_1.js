 I certainly don_t_t_co_ and why wait for the release of a crappy outdated VR goggle display?  The display has been in developer_t_s hands now for most of this year.  I just don_t_t get it - but I suppose when you receive 2 Billion _qt_with a capital B_qt_ dollars from Zuckerberg_co_ you really don_t_t have to do anything else.  And there will be much better displays released this year - in 2015.  Don_t_t wait for Oculus and don_t_t give them your money as they have a plenty a dollars - and it will be outdated when it_t_s FINALLY released.  Did I say release enough times?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Dare I say _qt_Magic Leap?_qt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2015-07-04T15:09:06Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_88111_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_15556_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_dbawel_qt_ data-cite_eq__qt_dbawel_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1435981451_qt__gt__lt_div_gt__lt_div_gt__lt_p_gt_And there will be much better displays released this year - in 2015.  ...Dare I say _qt_Magic Leap?_qt__lt_/p_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/blockquote_gt__lt_p_gt_Really?  Or are you talking about MS_t_s or Sony_t_s new toys?  Probably under NDA_co_ so not going to respond_co_   #@*$ bastard._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Personally_co_ if I am going to wear something on my head_co_ would also like to be able to see other things.  I also count 3D TVs_co_ since I have one.  As a developer_co_ as long as I can hit them with the same code base_co_ I am a fanguy.  Think there is a temptation by MS &amp_sm_ Sony to tie their stuff to their game consoles._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dbawel","Date":"2015-07-04T20:29:39Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hey Jeff_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Actually_co_ Magic Leap is much farther off for release than Oculus.  And Sony and Microsoft is pairing their headmounted displays to their gaming consoles_co_ however_co_ they will both accept native video and convert to 3D in real-time.  And Microsoft is developing more non game applications than Sony - tied to the Windows OS and Windows graphic and other applications.  So the Hololens will be a bit more versatile and robust - as well as to offer a better AR experience which is what you appear to be more interested in as most people are.  AR is a far better experience that straight VR in my opinion.  And of course_co_ Magic Leap does AR like no one else._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As for the Oculus Rift_co_ the Samsung Gear VR is available now for $200_co_ and is basically an Oculus Rift without the tracking camera on the device - and is actually licensed from Oculus.  Also keep in mind that the Samsung Gear requires a Galaxy Note 4 which will set you back $700 on top of the price of the Gear headset.  So when it comes to VR and AR_co_ never budget what you read on Amazon - always consider that most of these displays require additional hardware._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Sony_t_s project Morpheus looks promising as it runs natively with the PS4.  It should be out this Christmas_co_ and would be one of two headsets that would probably get my vote over the Oculus Rift - since they_t_ve taken the time to get the displays right using the best Sony display technology - which is a big difference compared to the Rift for color_co_ contrast_co_ and true resolution._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But the winner this year may very well be the Microsoft Hololens_co_ which looks really impressive.  In a perfect world_co_ I_t_d love for the Hololens to license Sony_t_s displays_co_ but of course_co_ these are the two companies in direct competition to own the home - and it will be difficult to pick a winner - it there ever is one.  I generally buy both Microsoft and Sony gaming and consumer hardware as they both are pretty awesome.  I_t_m glad there isn_t_t a clear winner_co_ as it just gives me more games and toys to play with.  I still have a couple of Sony Aibo_t_s running around my house_co_ and they_t_ve been living with me so long_co_ you might actually believe they are alive as they are trained so well._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But back to VR displays_co_ there is already the first direct retina projection system on the market_co_ and I_t_ve not been able to test this_co_ but I_t_ve heard really good reviews. Unfortunately_co_ this probably won_t_t be the winner in the headmounted display market as it_t_s a private company_co_ and they don_t_t have anywhere near the resources Oculus_co_ Sony_co_ Microsoft_co_ and Samsung have - unfortunately.  This is the Avegant Glyph.  And as you hinted in your post above_co_ I can_t_t divulge specifics about the Magic Leap device_co_ but this provides a glimpse of what_t_s on the horizon as the technology behind the Glyph is similar in application to Magic Leap - but _qt_similar_qt_ is as far as it goes. It might be comparable to comparing a glider to a spaceship. The Glyph is the lightest and smallest of all of the headmounted displays_co_ and does have the advantages of a direct retina projection system such as being a far more natural physicalogically accurate display_co_ which more closely mirrors the way natural light enters the human eye.  So there is far less eye strain_co_ it_t_s much less prone to creating nausea_co_ and the imagery is far more believable by the human brain.  However_co_ the similarities with Magic Leap pretty much end there._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The proprietary technology behind the Magic Leap display is straight out of a Star Trek world beyond anything that has yet to be invented in the real world.  As I_t_ve hinted at_co_ the Magic Leap device is more similar to a plug directly into your brain than it is a display device.  That_t_s all I can say for now_co_ but as those of you who have heard me hint at such things before_co_ the day the Magic Leap device is released to the public is the day the world literally changes._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In the meantime_co_ most of the 2D displays will be novel toys to play with_co_ and certainly have their place and time in entertainment media and gaming for now.  I_t_ll certainly buy one or more of these devices_co_ and it probably won_t_t be Oculus - not because of any reason except that it_t_s already dated technology.  I will most likely pick up both the Sony Morpheus and the Microsoft Hololens as they will be fully integrated into the PS4 and Xbox One respectively.  I would like to own the Avegant Glyph_co_ but I doubt that there will be much content unquely developed for this device_co_ so it will basically be used as an interpolated 3D headmounted display.  It_t_s a shame_co_ as it_t_s all about money and not quality.  Look at Oculus - there will be loads of games and apps supporting the Oculus Rift - but it_t_s interpolated display and averaged resoution won_t_t be anywhwere near the quality of other devices on the market.  And for those of you who simply want an inexpensive headmounted display of reasonable quality_co_ there_t_s always the Razer OSVR which is on the market now for $200 retail - and the quality is decent.  But as with other independant companies_co_ there won_t_t be much or any unique content available for these displays.  And as I previously mentioned_co_ remember that most displays coming on the market require an Android device or other additional hardware and software for video and audio processing.  So be sure to add to your headset budget approximately $500 to $800 in aditional monies to go VR and/or AR - on top of the cost of the headmounted display._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As promised_co_ I_t_ll do my best to keep you up to date on Magic Leap_co_ and as time progresses_co_ I am even more excited about the device than ever before.  However_co_ someone needs to start a Magic Leap addiction helpline and support group now - as people won_t_t want to leave their homes once this is released - seriously. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_ph34r.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_ph34r_dd__qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/ph34r@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
