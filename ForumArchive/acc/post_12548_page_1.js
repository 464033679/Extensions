Maybe I_t_m looking at this from the wrong approach?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_We have  character model mode up of maybe 10~12 parts_co_ and a single skeleton that controls all those parts. based on the example_co_ you_t_re assigning a whole clone of the skeleton to each sub mesh of the total character model. This would be very bad in the case of our animations that have 17000+ key frames (assuming we can even get the rigging simplified enough to use)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Do we need to load in all the sub-meshes and merge them into a single model_co_ then attach the skeleton_co_ or is there a way that we can attach all these sub-models to a single skeleton? I would rather be able to attach the sub-meshes to a single skeleton as it would be a simpler process for swapping equipment rather than reloading every piece of equipment_co_ merging them again_co_ then reattaching the skeleton. I would rather be able to just swap out the section that i need to replace as needed. The may be an issue with inheritance as the model inherits the skeleton instead of the other way around. If this is the case_co_ would it be possible to also let skeletons inherit meshes as needed for complex models like this?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Just trying to understand my best solution to this problem._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Example from the tutorial_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_pre class_eq__qt_ipsCode prettyprint_qt__gt_for (j _eq_ 1_sm_ j &lt_sm_ newMeshes.length_sm_ j++) {    c[j] _eq_ newMeshes[j].clone(_qt_c_qt_ + j)_sm_    c[j].position _eq_ new BABYLON.Vector3(xrand_co_ 0_co_ zrand)_sm_    c[j].skeleton _eq_ newMeshes[j].skeleton.clone()_sm_    scene.beginAnimation(c[j].skeleton_co_ 0_co_ 120_co_ 1.0_co_ true)_sm_}_lt_/pre_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2015-02-17T01:54:56Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Why not creating instances in this case?
