I_t_ve seen some bench mark reports for speed testing webCL vs just webGL and even though CL uses GL to render the 3D context the more intense calculations seem to work way faster.  I only recently discovered it from reading up on some cutting edge college lectures that I dug up one day by luck.   \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI want to be ahead of the ball and start learning it as much as possible because I have a feeling it_t_s going to be the main language in the future do to your ability to tell it what pipeline it_t_s using and I believe it makes real multithreading a possibility in browser.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JCPalmer","Date":"2017-02-22T16:51:01Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI do not know.  I would suggest just coding the minimum amount to create a WebCL context_co_ 2 lines maybe.  Run it on your hardware / browsers_co_ and you will know for sure.
