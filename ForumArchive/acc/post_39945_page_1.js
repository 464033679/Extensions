Right now I can move the objects around with _qt_pointerDragBehavior_qt__co_ but when I let go of the mouse button the object just drops like a stone. It would be nice if there was a built-in way to see the speed (and vector) of a dragged object_t_s motion_co_ since then I could just impart that linear velocity onto the object. What is the best way to measure a dragged object_t_s speed?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Azariel","Date":"2018-09-11T23:43:42Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFigured it out. Easiest way for me was to use the event object provided by pointerDragBehavior.onDragObservable. There_t_s an _qt_event.delta_qt_ object that has the change in coordinates since the last frame or update step_co_ which is basically velocity already.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Sebavan","Date":"2018-09-12T09:54:54Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMarked as solved this is exactly the way to do it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
