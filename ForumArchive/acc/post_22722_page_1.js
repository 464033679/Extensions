Of the 3 controllers I_t_ve been developing with the past 6 months_co_ I can say that for me personally and without a doubt_co_ that the Moga gamepad controllers - and specifically the Moga Pro Power Controller is the most compatible with the largest aray of mobile devices. It has 2 discrete pairing modes - _qt_A_qt_ mode which supports all HID drivers which are the most common to OS bluetooth default controls and games_co_ and _qt_B_qt_ pairing mode which I generally use as it is completely configurable to most any _qt_event_qt_ in your script or other control devices.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt also has the longest battery life based on a single charge - as much as 50% more than other controllers and benchmarked as the longest battery life by 25% over any other controller. But it is the compatability which is the real value here_co_ as I_t_m able to use with every game/app and OS I use and/or develop. Not to mention both analog and digital joysticks and buttons. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo I don_t_t know if this helps much_co_ but I can definately say that no other controller on the market is as compatible as the Moga Pro Power Bluetooth controller. And I_t_ve tried them all in every OS and with every browser. None are 100% universal_co_ but this controller is 100% configurable - however_co_ I rarely need to pre-configure. If you need any further help with this let me know and I can probably assist further - at least on a general level. And by the way_co_ this controller far out-performs Samsung_t_s GearVR controller as it supports far more devices_co_ but also natively supports all Samsung and GearVR controls with no addition configuration required.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_em_gt__lt_strong_gt_EDIT - _lt_/strong_gt_I_t_m going to go a bit off topic here_co_ because I just purchased _qt_EVE_dd_ GunJack_qt_ for the GearVR_co_ and it is as addictive as crack - not that I would personally know._lt_/em_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_blink_dd__qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_blink.png_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_blink_dd__qt_ /_gt_ But all_lt_em_gt_ kidding aside_co_ the VR experience in this game is equal to anything I_t_ve played yet. It truly is addictive_co_ and is keeping me from my work. Now it was developed using UE4 which I am a great fan and have used extensively_sm_ however_co_ as I_t_m very familiar with UE4_co_ I can definately say that this fantastic VR game could have been built in babylon.js with little or no differences in gameplay and/or graphics. So I hope to see more developers on this forum move in the VR and AR direction_co_ regardless of the display format. I_t_m looking forward to Magic Leap_t_s hardware_co_ however as they are 2 years from release_co_ everything I_t_m building for newly released VR displays is applicable to the upcoming AR and VR displays not yet released such as the Hololens (which is a step above Oculus in many ways)_co_ and then the pinnacle of AR which is Magic Leap - with the exception of the renderer and the physical mechanics of these displays. However_co_ such differences will be virtually transparent to the game developer as well as the required effort to develop for these displays at some point shortly following release._lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_em_gt_Anyway_co_ I just perhaps _qt_wasted_qt_  the past 2 hours until my S7 phone overheated (thank God for this)_co_ as this was the only reason I_t_m back to work now._lt_/em_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_rolleyes_dd__qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_rolleyes_dd__qt_ /_gt_ _lt_em_gt_And back to the topic_co_ the entire gaming experience is improved 100% (actually more for me) using the Moga controller - which as always works flawlessly with the new game.

Also when I have to fly and am not using the GearVR_co_ the controller also has an adjustable open phone mount built into the controller to easily attach most all smartphones to it in a screen display configuration - so that you are able to play any game quite comfortably like what I used to use for my Sony PSP in my past life.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt sounds like I should be a rep for Moga_co_ but it really is that awesome whether you are using it for VR or not.
