This new app along with the server allows any # of users to draw onto and manipulate 3D meshes as well as draw directly on video and design illustrations all in real time and at the same time - with fully synced actions.  Weta has been really looking forward to using this_co_ and they are in full support of BJS - which will only grow in the coming months._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So_co_ perhaps we might consider organizing some demos around a group of users here_co_ as opposed to all flying solo in building and posting demos.  We might consider focusing on our individual strengths and applying these to demo projects as a group.  It_t_s just a thought_co_ but I_t_m certainly willing to contribute from my personal experience in character animation_co_ motion capture_co_ audio engineering_co_ music composition_co_ and a few other aspects of both entertainment and industrial media.  I know everyone wants to build games_co_ so we can do this also_sm_ providing we don_t_t get carried away_co_ and build some mind blowing content to showcase this amazing framework which is our future - at least for most of us._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is an exciting time for me_co_ as well as I_t_m certain it is for most everyone on this forum.  Be prepared for a huge boom and acceptance of native HTML5 and WebGL apps and games in the coming year_co_ as well as all of the battles I_t_ve been fighting for groups I work with to adopt these standards and specifically BJS_co_ are about to come to fruition.  I know I_t_ve been on and off topic here a bit_co_ but I wanted to simply provide my perspective on the industry_co_ as well as proposing joining in on some organized demos which work on both an aesthetic and technical level.  I_t_ve seen all the components on this forum as well as amazing talent_sm_ it_t_s just a matter of pulling these all together to create some media which to blow people away._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And to benoit- 1842 congratulations on an actual contract earning income (hopefully) from using the Babylon.js framework.  I guarantee there_t_s a whole lot more of work to come using this fantastic set of tools and the engine driving it.  I know those of us who have not contributed to the writing of the actual framework are eternally grateful to those few who are still building and improving daily._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Again_co_ congrats!  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Vousk-prod.","Date":"2015-11-19T06:12:14Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Creating dedicated new demos and games would be excellent.
