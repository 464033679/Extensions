Anyway_co_ I_t_m trying to develop a project and I have some problems with moving the camera_co_ I believe they are somewhere in the registerBeforeRender function.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn order to make the camera able to rotate in any direction I attached it to a parent mesh and I_t_m moving it instead. In my html page I have a button_co_ which upon being pressedÂ should make the camera move to a certain position and rotate in a certain direction. I wanted the movement to be _qt_fluid_qt_ (the camera doesn_t_t _qt_jump_qt_ to said position but rather the user sees its movement)_co_ so I move it in the registerBeforeRender function_co_ a little bit every time.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy problem is that in some cases something goes wrong and the function collapses. I_t_m left with a blank canvas and all the meshes dissappear.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf anyone knows why that might happen I would appreciate an adive. Sadly I can_t_t add my code right now as it_t_s on another computer_co_ if it_t_s too hard to help me without it I_t_ll upload it here soon.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you in advance.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2016-01-19T17:11:39Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi Mr. Pudding_co_ welcome to the forum _dd_-)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWithout code it will be hard to help you.

It wasn_t_t so much the registerBeforeRender function itself but rather an unhaldled exeption from a math function that was called form it. I discovered that Vector3.normalize() can set the length of the vector to a little bit more than 1. That caused a problem in the arccos function (I was trying to get the angle between two vectors).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBy the way thanks for the tip RaananW_co_ I do not know how to use the follow camera yet but it might be helpful.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
