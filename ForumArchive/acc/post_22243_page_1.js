As a newbie I find it hard to ask the right question because lack of knowledge/terms that most developer use (I_t_m working on that). So this is my first project and I haven_t_t made any progress with just creating scenes in Babylon that load correctly which I tested a couple of times. So now I would like to ask what is the process of getting started?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_m using 3ds max exporter plugin/button and thanks to some advise I receive from one of my post I can import to Babylon.  My next question is about the workflow \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t1. If I don_t_t have lights in my scene in 3ds max is that the reason it not showing when I export to Babylon\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2.
