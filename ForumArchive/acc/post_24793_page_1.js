Having said this_co_ if you take a look at the HUGE number of  existing callbacks_co_ features_co_ object attributes_co_ object managment_co_ etc._co_ you_t_ll find what I_t_ve recently discovered - which is that I have been able to accomplish tasks which are quite difficult using only JS_co_ and for tackling most operations_co_ you would generally require a seperte extension to build anyway. However_co_ as you know jQuery provides a compatability and an integration with HTML and other type objects which far exceed most any extension you might require at some point in developing games and apps within any WebGL framework.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd although there is generally a bit of a learning curve associated with integrating jQuery into many of the functions and features in the babylon.js framework_co_ as well as soring through general usage with Javascript and HTML documents and objects_sm_ I_t_ve personally found considerably more abilities and flexabilities - even in the available attributes once an object is declared - such as simplifying my work with videoTextures in using jQuery to handle to HTML video and all of the available attribure control_co_ even down to calling the filename string values and propogating an HTML form with available media which requires me to write considerable additional code and the time involved_co_ and again considerably more compatability especially if the app design takes this into consideration and jQuery is no an afterthought.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo it is perhaps not that important nor is it essential for most developers and the games or apps which are currently in development according to what I read on the forum. However_co_ currently for myself and my team_co_ we would be writing and/or adopting additional extensions  and allot more code for a sizeable percentage of operations we are currently using - which in our case jQuery is providing. And if only to be experienced in efficient ways of using and integrating jQuery with Javascript and specifically the babylon.js framework_co_ we find that we have far less limitations than last year prior to our team adopting jQuery as a standard withing all of our sites and apps. And this reall helps us develop much more quickly without the worry of compatability_co_ as well as providing so many additional functions in managing and monitoring files and media - as we are now uploading much of our media to the Amazon servers and passing any liability to Amazon - as well as saving money in bandwidth and in efficiency. And jQuery assists us tremendously with integrating this and other media and data easily back into our WebGL scenes. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI was never a big fan either way on using jQuery_sm_ however_co_ the more I develop using jQuery integrated with BJS and JS in general_co_ I wish I already had spent the time in years past fully understanding just how far it can be integrated_co_ as well as learning to overcome what are considered limitations in using within JS frameworks_co_ WebGL objects_co_ and in _t_event_t_ security within browsers - as what I previously thought could not be done we are now doing. And this inclused how we manage media on our_t_s and other media servers. Simply providing file readers and loaders_co_ aquiring and setting all of the available attributes and document info_co_ and syncing files between multiple users - using jQuery (when useful and appropriate) has personally saved me thousands of lines of code and countless time to develop and manage the code and processes while maintaining full compatability in many of our apps today. I_t_m no derious advocate of jQuery beyond what you most likely already know. However_co_ I did have an adverse opinion and thought it was somewhat of a nightmare integrating prior to my experience recently - which has clearly showed that as a standard (which I would consider jQuery to be)_co_ I have been able to accomplish operations which do not exist within BJS and/or without other extensions_sm_ as well as to find myself far less limited in what functionality I can create and integrate in far less time than ever before - and with far greter flexability that I had thought possible. I_t_m just embarassed that it took me so long to get on the train and simply spend the time gaining the experience which now allows me to unlock this immense power that was always starring me right in the face.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo this post goes far_co_ far beyond what I thought I would reply_co_ however_co_ it_t_s more about my ignorance to jQuery than it is to the immense power available when understanding when and how to use it. I doubt this post will help anyone_co_ but if just one person takes the time to really learn how and when to use and integrate jQuery witin the WebGL framework_co_ then it was worth my time writing. Otherwise_co_ I know I_t_m siply preaching to the chior_co_ and that this pobably reads more like a motivational speech than an answer on a developer_t_s forum.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_EDIT - _lt_/strong_gt__lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8420-royibernthal/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8420_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8420-royibernthal/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@royibernth_lt_/a_gt_ - I didn_t_t answer your question_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_141647_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_24793_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1472296352_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_8420_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_royibernthal_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t11 hours ago_co_ royibernthal said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tI_t_m familiar with jQuery.

Not that three.js is a poor framework_co_ but BJS is far more suitable for my development needs. I did add an edit to my lengthy post on this topic since you last read it (at least commented)_co_ but it doesn_t_t answer the above. My last post was written more for the potential benefit of newbies_co_ as I wish I had personally focused on just a few specifics such as jQuery before I began to develop products for release in languages I hd little experience using previously.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHowever_co_ as for your last question_co_ obviously there are many methods you might use to accomplish the same end result_sm_ and with little difference in overall performance. So I wouldn_t_t want to be too specific_co_ as I assume I would be covering areas which you are already familiar - such as using literal declarations as opposed to global varialbles and flags. But it all depends on your specific game and/or app.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo I_t_m a bit hesitant to proceed based upon your broadly asked question_co_ as most of what I_t_m providing below are standard JS and BJS operations. But here goes anyway - I just ask that all of the _qt_amazing_qt_ users on this forum know that this is simply my own preference_sm_ if I_t_m buiding a _qt_generic_qt_ app based upon the above question asked.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo if I_t_m actually building and not testing_co_ I prefer declaring literal objects - especially in developing a product_co_ but it_t_s good to exercise this in any case.
