One of the features i have i using the Unity Built-in terrain data to Generate native babylon grounds (using createGroundFromHeightmap). But can_t_t get REALLY smooth hills and mountains (without ALOT of tessellation ).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo as an experiment_co_ instead of just using the metadata to store terrain metadata that is created on client side with createGroundFromHeightmap...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI make 2 meshes from the terrain... The first one I scale down to about 5000 verts i was intending to use this as a _t_Collision Mesh_t_ that you can walk around on... No materials on it with a REALLY low visibility of 0.000001 is REALLY blocky BUT at least follow the outline of the original mesh for the purpose of the camera collisions so you can walk on smoothly... Then i render out a much more detailed terrain mesh (MAX 65000 Verts) to use as more of a _qt_Visual Effect_qt_ mesh that actually has all smooth mesh contours... I just OVERYLAY them in exact same position and rotation of parent HOLDER mesh object.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy hope was to provide a Detailed Terrain Mesh so it looks good (BUT YOU CANT WALK AROUND ON MORE THAN 10000-12000 verts without MAJOR FPS drop) and much lower poly version of the terrain with its collisions set to true so you don_t_t fall thru ground and you still go up and down to follow the contour of the terrain.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut as long as i don_t_t make that detailed mesh collisions true... The dual mesh approach seems ok on my machine with NOT TOO BAD frame drop. Now granted its not the whole game yet with all the other game assets and logic... But seems ok so far.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy question is (because I_t_m new to game programming concepts)... SHOULD i be doing shit like that... or is that too much for a HTML WebGL based games (or a string of babylon scenes put together to be a game)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am OLD SCHOOL... from the days of _t_KISS_t_ programming (Keep It Simple Stupid) and i want to put kool and useful features in the toolkit.

There is a Box Collider Component (capsule_co_ sphere and mesh as well) and it looks to me that NO MATTER the original mesh geometry is_co_ if you want collision_co_ you NEED one of the collider components which creates a simplified mesh... So i think you end of with two meshes for everything that has to collide...
