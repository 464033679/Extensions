This can slow down development in the testing stage of game development_co_ since after finding bugs and fixing them you need to build the game again (building WebGL inside C++ engine is both resource and time-consuming process) and again for every fix or new feature or updates etc... However_co_ this is not the case for JS engines_co_ where you can simply refresh the page in your browser and see the changes immediately. Perhaps the only drawback of JS engines is the lack of advanced Editors (which is not really important since you can do pretty amazing stuff sometimes with only 1 line of code_co_ considering JS game engines are designed to be simple_co_ Babylon.js can be example for this) and this won_t_t be case in the future_co_ we already see emergence of JS game engine editors like _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//editor.babylonjs.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_this_lt_/a_gt_ and there is some hard work going on in this field particularly.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHave a nice day! _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"kenta88","Date":"2016-04-03T12:41:33Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi guys_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks to temechon and omar for replies! \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/20291-omar/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_20291_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/20291-omar/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@OMAR_lt_/a_gt_ your answer is great!

It is capable of running almost on any device with a GPU and a browser installed in to it_co_ Perhaps you meant performance issues that we can encounter in mobile GPUs_co_ but as a Unity and (mainly) UE4 game developer I can assure you that C++ engines aren_t_t really _qt_winners_qt_ when dealing with optimization stuff as well. Especially UE4 specifically disables its powerful Temporal-AntiAliasing technique if you target mobile platforms for your game. Of course_co_ you can achieve high-end graphics on mobile thanks to _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.khronos.org/vulkan/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Vulkan API_lt_/a_gt_ recently released by the _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.khronos.org/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Khronos Group_lt_/a_gt_ and I already tested it with UE4 (they implemented this feature to their engine just after the release) and then built it for Android to test it on my Xperia (which later on got overheated as hell just like when I use Google Cardboard VR apps). Long story short_co_ no matter what engine or graphics API you use_co_ you will always face problems when building games for mobile platforms. If you choose iOS though_co_ this problem gets a little bit easier to solve since you will have to test it only on a couple of devices (same with Windows Phone I think) but if you also target Android_co_ then well_co_ good luck with that. My personal opinion on this matter is that you cannot achieve an ideally designed game that runs and looks great on all platforms at the same time no matter what type of technology or API you are using in doing so. What I think is that you have to choose a specific platform for your game and optimize it for that particular _qt_target_qt_ platform you_t_ve chosen_co_ then even that other platforms (and thus other customers you might have gained) can_t_t play your game_co_ the ones that can will definitely be satisfied with quality and performance you have provided. On the other hand_co_ what makes WebGL superior on this matter_co_ is that it is so flexible and easy that when you target mobile platforms you don_t_t go through a bulk of work that mobile developers usually have to deal with (SDKs_co_ lots of testing because of various  compatibility issues_co_ buying developer license etc.)_co_ in WebGL though_co_ just make your game_co_ put it on Web_co_ and that_t_s it! In the past my main concern about WebGL was dealing with all the low-level stuff while programming WebGL games (like writing shaders_co_ then creating programs and linking them etc.) but now we have these powerful WebGL frameworks like _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_this _lt_/a_gt_and _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//threejs.org/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_this _lt_/a_gt_that do all the work for you. Now at this moment it_t_s more about you (the developer) and the game (or in general_co_ GPU-accelerated Web App) you are going to make and the way you are going to implement it_co_ rest is handled for you.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Pryme8","Date":"2016-04-04T01:03:42Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tits javascript_co_ its lightweight_co_ its cross platform_co_ its extendable_co_ its free\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"kenta88","Date":"2016-04-04T09:20:51Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_123506_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_21631_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1459707586_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_5453_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_jerome_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t15 hours ago_co_ jerome said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tthe real question would be _dd_ why to keep using Unity for the Web_co_ knowing that BJS exists ? _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYes!
