You may even find that with someone with clothing who has wrinkles etc might drop by 50x (or more) in file size. Also texturing can make something with extremely low poly appear high poly._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_I_t_ve learnt that with webgl you need to think a little differently and sometimes outside the box. ie webgl/opengl only supports up to 8 lights (although some hardware won_t_t run 8 lights) so for me this may seem like a limitation_co_ however lights can be disabled and enabled meaning that I can write code that will disable lights that are not on the screen_co_ so I could have 30 lights in my scene but only need 4 active on the screen at any one time. If I was making a game in Unity I probably wouldn_t_t even think of that and when it came to deployment I would be stuck with the game only working on some hardware and would possibly have to halve the lights I just made in the game to make it work on all hardware._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_You should always be trying to get the most out of the least. I have a model I have created in 3ds max and with one level of smoothing difference it jumps from 30K polys to 150k polys however there is no noticeable difference in the look. _lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ozRocker","Date":"2015-02-01T06:44:26Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_My models originally started with about a million polys.  They are from 3D scans of real people from my photogrammetry multi-cam rig.  I decimate them down to 100k polys.  When I go lower I do notice the difference.  The features in the face get noticeably sharper.  It wouldn_t_t be a problem for gaming or quickly animated characters_co_ but I_t_m making portfolios for people (in this case my personal trainer friend)_co_ so I_t_m trying to make them look realistic with the bare minimum number of polys.  However_co_ it is a strain on mobile devices so I might just resort to using a low-poly mesh and smaller texture when viewed on mobile_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"spritefire","Date":"2015-02-01T07:22:44Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_do you use normals and bump maps?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_You should be able to drop the polys quite a lot without losing the detail and you may even be able to replicate the look you had at a higher polycount of 100k at the same time by baking the million poly character into bump mapped textures ie you might have the same look and detail of a million polys at 50k etc_lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_Have a look around on the net also_co_ you will find similar looking details of the push up guy around 30k. _lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_If you have the equipment that scans people at a million polygons you may as well bake it so that you are keeping the detail otherwise you might as well have scanning equipment that only does 100k _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"gryff","Date":"2015-02-01T07:45:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt__gt__lt_div_gt_However_co_ it is a strain on mobile devices_lt_/div_gt__lt_/blockquote_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ozrocker_co_ you might want to look at this video of a presentation by Michel Rousseau from about 4.20-&gt_sm_9.00mins.
