Thank God for the adoption of HTML5 and WebGL_co_ or the answer to your question would ultimately be no.  But again_co_ there_t_s no new info for you in anything I_t_ve written above._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_m excited about BabylonJS because I can already develop and deliver quality content_co_ and even though the framework currently may not offer everything I want right now_co_ it certainly will in the future - and that_t_s exciting.  We_t_re right on the edge of this new way of creating and delivering games and content_co_ and you_t_ll be the expert while others try and catch up in the future - if you stick with it.  Aside from the technical challenges_co_ I_t_d say it_t_s all about goals.  If you want to produce a game and then move onto something other than making games_co_ I_t_d personally use UE4.  But then you_t_re limited to the platforms which your game can be played. It_t_s also way more work than most people understand to produce a game on your own_co_ and really easy to get lost and give up because you don_t_t have the community support._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But if you want to continue making games_co_ you_t_re right where you should be_sm_ as the future only holds a place for developers on server based platforms. Consoles will go away_co_ and everything will be made to be mobile - whether it can be played on a desktop or not.  _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As far as technically - you can develop and produce the game you described above now.  However_co_ there are the limitations you_t_re already aware of.  I would also make sure you have a pipeline similar to what was discussed on the other post for building and animating characters.  The poly count and other limitations are my greatest fear_co_ although these limitations will be less and less in a very short time.  But that doesn_t_t help you or I right now._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So my solution was to build my server from scratch - which I had no experience in building servers - but built relationships with other developers who do. Now I have a server which dynamically streams data_co_ and this is what will allow me to create and publish whatever I want using BabylonJS_co_ since I_t_m no longer reliant on a linear download of all elements prior to launching a game.  I_t_m sure you know I could go on and on about other aspects (as most people on this site know I can write some monstrous posts_co_) but I_t_m glad you asked this question - which is very different from what was asked in the post you referenced from yesterday. I really want to hear what everyone else has to say.  I_t_ll just tell you that you can build and publish the game you briefly described without sacraficing quality or gameplay using BabylonJS.  But only if you work _qt_out of the box._qt_  And you_t_ll probably build a better game because of the limitations and circumstances in which we have to work. Otherwise_co_ there_t_s a good chance you may never finish your game - as once you_t_re on your own and not working in an idea driven community like this_co_ you_t_ll most likely never finish a game.  Most people don_t_t.  I_t_m saying this from experience - been there done that.  Technically - you can absolutely develop and finish your game in BabylonJS. That_t_s my opinion._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_strong_gt__lt_em_gt_POST EDIT_dd_ _lt_/em_gt__lt_/strong_gt_I_t_ve also built (with a development partner) a graphic authoring tool which functions exactly the way you described.  I can load any elements I want into the interface_co_ edit them together or seperately_co_ and then it_t_s all about the timeline and setting up events to drive the elements and media I_t_ve loaded. I can then simply push a button and publish the stream.  So can it be done?  Yes.  And trust me - if I can do it_co_ anyone can._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jahow","Date":"2015-04-27T06:32:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hey_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_By reading you it seems there are two things that worry you the most_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_1. will you be able to achieve sufficient performance on your game? and_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_2. will you be able to find/code adequate authoring tools?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_About performance_dd_ it will be your every day struggle_co_ that I can guarantee (it_t_s probably already the case).

Also you_t_ve probably have your level editor already fleshed out_co_ if I remember what I_t_ve seen from you here. I honestly think that if you focus on putting features in your authoring tools_co_ and make them as simple as possible_co_ it is largely doable. For example_co_ a cutscene editor can probably be nothing else than your basic text editor_co_ where you_t_d write stuff such as_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_div_gt__lt_div_gt_00_dd_03 [activecamera_dd_1]_lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_p_gt_00_dd_12 [entity_dd_ John] [anim_dd_ Talk]_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_00_dd_15 [activecamera_dd_ 2]_lt_/p_gt__lt_div_gt_00_dd_17 [entity_dd_ Jim] [anim_dd_ Talk]_lt_/div_gt__lt_div_gt_I_t_m really making this up as I go. But there always are tricks for making things simple._lt_/div_gt__lt_div_gt_Also_co_ a level editor is after not much more than your game engine with the added ability to add/remove objects in the scene_co_ edit their properties_co_ save/load and include a rudimentary scripting system (may not even be necessary)._lt_/div_gt__lt_div_gt_ _lt_/div_gt__lt_div_gt_All in all_co_ I_t_d say the challenges you_t_ll face when making a game with BJS won_t_t be _t_bigger_t_ than with other engines. They will just be very different_co_ and much more instructive in my opinion. And browser-based games will probably become very common in the times to come_co_ seeing as how the browsers themselves are handling graphics better and better.
