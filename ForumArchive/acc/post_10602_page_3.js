The radiusReset variable should only set to true if the radius was actually changed. That was the reason to some of the flickering._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The other reason was fastCheck in the pick function. The problem was that the outer wall of the skull was detected and returned a hit. Setting the camera inside the skull actually made sense - you can see the object through the eye/nose etc_t__co_ but it is not the desired functionality._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Changing fast check to false inspects all of the parts of the mesh and returns the smallest distance. but (as the name suggests) it is slower. So maybe with walls_co_ fastCheck set to true is correct_co_ but with complex meshes_co_ false is the right choice. Two arrays with _qt_simple meshes_qt_ and _qt_complex meshes_qt_ might come in handy _dd_-)_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2015-02-09T23:08:39Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Thank you Raanan for your help. it seems perfect. This would be useful I think that such functionality is integrated directly into the engine._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_[edite] arf_co_ It depends on the models_co_ with some models_co_ I have a flash of the camera._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2015-02-10T00:17:05Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_I think I understood why.
