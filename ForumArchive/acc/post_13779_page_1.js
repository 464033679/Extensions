I have seen in other post that oimjs doesn_t_t detect collisions and this is a big problem for tha game that I_t_m doing that is similar to Arkanoid but in 3D. I need impulse the ball when collide with the bar and need detect when the ball collide with some box for it disappears. How can I resove this problem?
