We are happy to help you with questions as you are working on your game. What you are seeing is that your mesh is writing into the transparent queue as Max saw there was alpha values on your material and vertices and placed it into the transparent queue. When you have a complex mesh in the transparent queue_co_ you will see sorting errors as it does not have the benefit of a depth buffer and does not know what face should be in front in all viewing angles. Here are a few things you can do_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ol_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tI would suggest exporting your files from Max as a glTF file as you can load that directly in BabylonJS_co_ but also take advantage of the many glTF viewers that are available like the BabylonJS Sandbox (_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//sandbox.babylonjs.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//sandbox.babylonjs.com/_lt_/a_gt_)_co_ Mixed Reality Viewer for Windows_co_ Sketchfab_co_ etc. This gives you a way to debug what is happening in your mesh by being able to see how several renderers deal with the file. If you see your issue pop up in one of the other renderers_co_ you know the issue is in the file. \n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tI would avoid placing color on your vertices unless you really need to for some reason. It_t_s much easier and will create a smaller file to assign materials to your meshes. If you have alpha on your vertices_co_ you will end up with the mesh in the transparent queue as the exporter will see the alpha and set the alpha mode accordingly.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tTo set up your materials correctly in Max_co_ refer to the docs at _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/resources/3dsmax_to_gltf#pbr-materials_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/resources/3dsmax_to_gltf#pbr-materials_lt_/a_gt_ for reference. You will need to make sure that your transparency weight is set to none to make sure you output your model in the opaque queue.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tIf you still have an issue with the export to glTF_co_ you can easily open the glTF file in an editor like VSCode (_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//code.visualstudio.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//code.visualstudio.com/_lt_/a_gt_) and quickly change the alpha mode to the correct format which is detailed on this page_dd_   _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#alpha-coverage_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#alpha-coverage_lt_/a_gt_\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tVSCode is also another place that can view your glTF file by adding the glTF extension. You can search for glTF in the extensions tab and you will find it. \n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tIf you need your asset to be double-sided_co_ you can add the double-sided property into your glTF manually_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#double-sided_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#double-sided_lt_/a_gt_ and an example can be found in _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/2.0/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/2.0/FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf_lt_/a_gt_ line 535. \n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tThere is a blog post I wrote about the art pipeline into glTF_co_ which is a little dated now and I am working on an update. It shows how you can even export your glTF directly from Substance Painter if you like.
