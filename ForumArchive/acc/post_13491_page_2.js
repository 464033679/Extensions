where you want the weapon to move with the hand_co_ but remain rigid and not deform on the vertex level when bones are transformed.  But you don_t_t want to scale your mesh on it_t_s local axis if it is weighted/bound to a skeleton.  You want to transform the bones that the vertices are weighted/bound to._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Also_co_ you can transform most any object to either it_t_s local or the global/world axis.  However_co_ if you want to scale _qt_extend/extrude_qt_ a mesh such as a leg_co_ then if you want to do this using scaling_co_ you definately have to scale the bone to which the mesh is weighted on it_t_s local axis_co_ so the vertices transform along the bones local axis.  Transforming a mesh to the global axis will be quite messy.  Usually the z axis runs down the length of the bone - depending on which software you used to bind the mesh to the skeleton.  So you most likely want to scale on only the z axis (or appropriate single axis running the length) of the bone in which the leg mesh is weighted - if you want to extend the leg to be longer un-naturally - using scale.  _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_However_co_ depending on which bone you scale_co_ this will also affect the bone_t_s children which can look quite bad and really un-natural.  So if you want to extend the leg for a kick that will make the leg un-naturally longer_co_ then I wouldn_t_t scale - I would set up your skeleton hierarchy in a way that allows you to physically translate the leg bones down their parent_t_s z axis_co_ and I would personally do this by using a null as a parent to the thigh bone and translate this in the direction of the axis that would extent the leg to make it appear longer - if you really wanted to do this.  I would translate and scale on the bones themselves as little as possible_co_ as this can cause unwanted deformations - especially since the leg is most likely bending as well - however_co_ if parented to a null_co_ it_t_s far more controllable and you can orient your null parent any direction and on any axis that is optimal to transform.  This also allows you to bend the leg at the same time without unwanted/un-natural vertex deformations.  I hope this make sense.  It takes a bit of playing around with different configurations of parenting to null objects or other small bones used only for the translation - and experimenting with different hierarchies to make it work optimally.  Good luck._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"dbawel","Date":"2015-04-08T19:34:58Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hey Joshcamas_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I hope you were able to find a solution that works for your scene.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DBawel_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"joshcamas","Date":"2015-04-18T19:44:08Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_I haven_t_t worked on this.
