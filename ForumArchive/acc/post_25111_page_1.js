It was designed/built to lay the foundation of a GUI library_co_ but the foundation itself already required a lot of time to achieve the many goals set from the start. I_t_m starting since the beginning of the week to work on the GUI library_co_ as you can expect_co_ it won_t_t be out soon_co_ I intend to do something as rich as Canvas2D itself and with the best performance possible (nobody would want the GUI to take half of the CPU/GPU time_co_ so I have to be cautious on this).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo for you_co_ I guess the best is to start like the others did_dd_ learn the foundation feature_co_ try to built some custom UI on the top of it. If you can live with it through time_dd_ that_t_s great.
