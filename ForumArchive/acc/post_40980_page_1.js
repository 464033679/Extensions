I understand I can set a collider for a mesh - so I can create a greedy mesh (generate one mesh of faces to use as the collider). Can I then set that collider to be pickable so that moving the mouse cursor around (we raycast every frame so we can highlight interesting things to click on) only picks from the collider?_lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tI_t_m thinking the most efficient way to do this is to merge the voxels into a set of axis aligned cubes (using some kind of greedy algorithm) and use that as the collider / physics model_co_ then greedy mesh the voxels into a non-visible but pickable mesh - is this the best solution or am I overthinking it?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-11-01T15:04:42Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo the picking is a pretty easy question_dd_ You can use any kind of impostors as long as you set isPickable _eq_ true on them\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor a world as big as yours I would recommend using simple impostors so I do not think you are over-engineering it _lt_span_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt_true_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
