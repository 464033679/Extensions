I_t_ve used THREE.js before and I recently switched to babylon for a project I_t_m doing and I love it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFirst_co_ I made my scene in Unity and used their exporter which worked great at first_co_ but I noticed that the exporter bakes in lighting and that_t_s not the effect I_t_m going for. I_t_ve decided then to try and make a scene just with pure javascript because it isn_t_t a very complicated scene. However_co_ I_t_m a big fan of the loading screen/feedback that is recieved when using the BABYLON.SceneLoader and I wanted to know if there was an easy way to take a scene I made in javascript and convert it to a .babylon file so I could use the SceneLoader?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t-TestyRabbit\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"JohnK","Date":"2017-06-18T08:40:04Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi and welcome to the forum. The answer is yes and I did it a couple of years ago so some bits are a bit hazy but here goes.
