Whatever_co_ I do not see that a wrong to say his opinons. I really like Babylon. Sometimes I want to contribute_co_ but I_t_m not very comfortable with TS and not necessarily talented to contribute on a major engine. I think that TS has been chosen in part to attract contributors more talented rather than attract contributors beginner.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI remember the beginnings of Babylon when he came out. It was about developing a JavaScript engine for JavaScript love_co_ it was a nice language and now I have the impression that it is a bad language_co_ that those who use it have nothing understand even in the future_co_ we_t_re late_co_ we can use it in 2 years or more_co_ that TS is better. But there is no bad language for me. I don_t_t like the languages _t_compile_t__co_ I prefer languages Web_co_ PHP_co_ JS and I use simple IDE as notePad++_co_ faster to open and more direct _co_ so I must have understood nothing and I_t_ll stay late in this case because I don_t_t use TS. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWingnut to reasons_dd_ attract other contributors more experiment to lose another category more amateur or comfortable with JS Hence the choice of TS. Yes JS is always present for users of the engine_co_ so no problem since we are just user. But I still miss the days where everything was done in JavaScript because Babylon was built like that for love of the JavaScript_co_ it was a great language and now it_t_s TS which is great and JS a lot of default. So maybe I should stop my view project that JS is not a good choice. I ask myself questions while reading all the posts here_co_ I made the right choice for my big project view HeroonEngine as JavaScript is despise by the developers.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t take any party_co_ I_t_m not against or for. I_t_m just saying that there are no bad language_co_ that_t_s what I want to believe_co_ the choices are made to attract a certain category of people_co_ and not another_co_ not because a language is better than another. We may be comfortable with one and not the other_co_ it is not the language that we do not control_co_ a shit. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tsome are planning to contribute on an engine only_co_ Babylon is a great choice_co_ but everyone does not come to contribute_co_ they_t_re coming to create a project personal_co_ commercial or not_co_ using this engine (am I doing part of its people). And this small category of fans is despise by what it does not contributes. This isn_t_t because it_t_s open source that needs to contribute and it is not because it does not contribute that one must be despise or took high as _lt_span_gt__lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt__lt_/span_gt_ can be to take the decision to go. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSorry if my English is not very understandable._lt_br /_gt_\n\t.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2017-03-03T13:15:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_165678_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_28773_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1488463388_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_5482_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_davrous_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t23 hours ago_co_ davrous said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tWell_co_ I definitely think you_t_re wrong.
