The game is *largely* 2d_co_ in fact could probably be done in entirely in 2d. Not too get too mired in the details_co_ but the game is mostly a fast paced card game_co_ and it_t_s going to require clean and readable text. Plan is to have it work on mobile and web browsers.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou_t_re probably wondering why I_t_m considering a largely 3d world like Babylon. The thing is I_t_ve been a Unity developer for last last 8 years_co_ and I_t_ve gotten comfortable making 2d games which occasionally take advantage of 3d (to use a card game example_co_ a card might be a 3d object that flips into place -- you know_co_ the kind of thing you see in Hearthstone or Artifact or whatever).  You probably know why I_t_m not using Unity_co_ but just in case_co_ it_t_s because their webgl export is slow on desktops and broken on mobile.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo far in my early testing though I_t_m a little worried about how hard this is going to be in Babylon.js... Orthographic camera seems a little lightly supported_co_ and text via DynamicTexture seems like it might be hard to get nice clean text with?  That_t_s just first impressions_co_ so I may be wrong.  Any good babylon playground example of 2d or pseudo-2d games with integrated text?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tShould I be looking at Phaser instead?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks in advance for any advice!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"enriqueto","Date":"2018-12-03T10:44:17Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_d try with Phaser 3_co_ it will be easier to produce the game interface and menus\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-12-03T16:50:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAgree with _lt_span_gt__lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/6579-enriqueto/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_6579_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/6579-enriqueto/_qt_ id_eq__qt_ips_uid_6636_5_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@enriqueto_lt_/a_gt__lt_/span_gt_For the 3D part of your game you can share the gl context between Bjs and Phaser. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
