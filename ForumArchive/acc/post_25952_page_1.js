It is effectively a motorised diving bell - but rather than taking just one head it takes 3 people - the qualified pilot and two passengers. You can see that entry into the sub is via the opening under the tail. All three sit in a bubble of air which is constantly refreshed throughout the dive of course. The lower half of the body is in water the upper half in the bubble. The pressure of the air bubble must always equal the pressure of the water thus_co_ just like scuba diving_co_ the people need to equalise (pop their ears) as the sub descends. Given the pressure inside and out is equal_co_ the body is fibreglass not 3_qt_ steel plate found in deep water submersibles.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe horizontal propellers move the sub back/forth/side. Flooding/blowing ballast in the nose and tail allows the sub to descend / ascend but as the golden safety rule must be to always maintain slight  positive buoyancy the vertical thrusters are used to exert downward pressure as the sub wants to always rise due to it_t_s positive buoyancy. The vertical thrusters can be operated manually by the pilot not via the joystick by a separate toggle switch but for the main are they are computer controlled keeping the sub at a depth set by the pilot.  \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSafety wise - the sub has dual systems_co_ spare air supply etc but the overall safety that prevents the sub from an uncontrolled descent (sinking is such a bad word in the world of submarines) is maintaining positive buoyancy.
