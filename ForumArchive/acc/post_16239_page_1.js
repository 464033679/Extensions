I have never been deceived by that bone structure and make walk.  It works with almost all the bvh I am sending to it.  What type of file are you using in Unity ? Bvh_co_ .dae_co_ FBX....  I would be interest to know what are the 12 retargeting systems you have tried..._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"xirvr","Date":"2015-11-13T01:19:38Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_+1 for skeletal animation in the Unity exporter.    _lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
