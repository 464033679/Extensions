I wanted to create a seperate post for everyone to read_co_ as the post where this dialogue has taken place is labled _qt_console errors._qt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I have been working on an app which relies heavily on playing video files and specifically video textures. I found that almost 2 months ago_co_ I had no problem playing video files and the associated audio on desktops and laptops no problem_sm_ but I could not get my video files to playback on most all mobile devices - both Android and Apple phones and tablets. Although at the time_co_ I wasn_t_t focused on inding a solution_co_ as I had other features to build into the application to finish it_co_ and believed that solving video playback on mobile devices wouldn_t_t be much of a problem._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So over the past 2 months I spent time each week to try and solve the fact that I couldn_t_t get any video files to play back on my Android tablet_co_ without finding a solution. But now that I have most all features built in the app_co_ I needed to find a solution to be able to take the app into beta testing now as the app is designed to be a mobile app and wouldn_t_t run on most tablets and phones - practically none._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As I had used most all available applications to encode and convert video files to .webm and .ogv files for playback on mobile_co_ I began to believe that it was either a bug in babylon.js_co_ or a conflict in my lengthy scripts. So I worked for days trying to find the cause of the problem_co_ and certainly went to the BJS forum where many highly experienced users attempted to help me troubleshoot and solve the video playback problem. However_co_ neither the balon.js community or I could get any video file or format to play on most mobile devices - with the exception of audio playback on some files._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So when I was completely lost a couple of days ago_co_ I thought I would focus on analyzing the video files and formats themselves_co_ to make certain that I could rule out video encoding and file conversion. After spending more than 2 days_co_ I finally found that the problem had nothing to do with my scripting or with babylon.js_co_ but that it was an encoding and file format issue. Now I have video and audio playback working on every device I and my friends are able to test_co_ as well as every browser and OS version._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Again_co_ I wanted to post this as a new thread_co_ since many users will most likely overlook this discovery and information_co_ since the post where this occured says nothing about video in the title and tags. And I hope that no one else will ever need to face the problems of having no solution or available resources to solve the problem of video palyback on mobile devices. The following is the solution as a quote directly from the post where I and several other users spent considerable time and dialogue over several days with no solution we could find_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt__gt__lt_div_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_Finally - I have the video and audio correctly playing on all tested mobile devices_co_ browsers_co_ and OS versions. The problem was a video encoding issue. Although I used every application I could including Premiere_co_ Sony Vegas_co_ and so many others_co_ and attempting to encode videos using literally every online converter to .webm and .ogv_co_ none of these would provide proper encoding for playback on all mobile devices - yet none of these formats which I encoded in various applications and online played back both video and audio correctly on my desktops and of course laptops. And I had no idea if it was a conflict in my scripts_co_ an issue with multiple canvas_t_ and dynamic materials and textures_co_ or some unknown bug I_t_d had the bad fortune to run into._lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_So the solutions I found are to use either Sony Vegas_co_ Premiere (which I was already using to encode video and audio)_co_ although I now prefer and recommend the VLC player/converter for encoding .mp4 video files for the very best control and optimization for an HTML5 video or a videoTexture in babylon.js - within all browsers I tested today. So encoding and playback .mp4 video files using most video editors and encoders was never a problem on desktops and most browsers_co_ but the best solution in my opinion for .mp4 is definately the VLC player/converter._lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_Now_co_ for the main problem which I have been having playback issues for 2 months now_co_ is that I could not encode a .webm or .ogv video file for playback on all mobile devices_co_ and at best_co_ only audio and rarely video playback worked - dependng on the mobile device and the browser on various tablets and phones - both Android and Iphone._lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_So in despair I kept at it_co_ and after trying practically everything I could think of_co_ I spent the past two days just working on encoding and analyzing the resulting video_co_ compression_co_ bitrates_co_ etc. What I discovered is that if I encode both the .webm and .ogv using the FireFogg extension for FireFox_co_ and using the correct advanced settings_co_ I now have video files which so far have played back both video and audio correctly on multiple mobile devices_co_ OS versions_co_ and browsers without fail._lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_rgb(90_co_90_co_90)_sm_font-family_dd_helvetica_co_ arial_co_ sans-serif_sm_font-size_dd_13px_sm_background-color_dd_rgb(234_co_248_co_226)_sm__qt__gt_I found that I did not need to modify my scene (scripts and application) in any way - that the problem was only due to encoding and conversion of video files.

Always keep in mind that many of these settings are dependant on the source video file_co_ as all of the quality settings may not be available to you if your source video is of low quality for video and/or audio. So you will want to begin all conversions from the highest quality video/audio source available.

I recommend setting a bitrate of 128 Kbps_co_ however_co_ anything lower than 64 Kbps will definately sound like crap - and for video files of a few minutes or less_co_ you will see very little difference in file size between 64 Kbps and 128 Kbps._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Next_co_ set your Mixdown menu to either read Mono or Stereo. I generally use Mono for videoTextures which are simply playing on an object in a scene as background_co_ however if you want more fidelity_co_ then of course you can select Stereo - however Mono will allow you to more easily mix the audio of your screen into a global stereo mix for your scene_co_ providing better directional audio if moving around in a gaming environment._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But if your focus is the video itself_co_ then choose stereo_co_ as you will certainly get better fidelity from this - especially if it is a song recorded in stereo.

Make sure the _qt__lt_em_gt_Video_lt_/em_gt__qt_ checkbox is selected_co_ and input the following_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_A.  Your X and Y resolution for _qt__lt_em_gt_size_lt_/em_gt__qt_ (Width and Height)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_B.  _qt__lt_em_gt_Framerate_lt_/em_gt__qt_ set to 30 (fps)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_C.  _qt__lt_em_gt_Aspect ratio_lt_/em_gt__qt_ (which should be either 4_dd_3 or 16_dd_9)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_D.  _qt__lt_em_gt_Bitrate_lt_/em_gt__qt_ which should be 1000 (Kbps) or greater - please read above_co_ however_co_ this can be lower than your MP4 file as both the .webm and .ogv video files will be dispalyed on screens of lower resolution than your MP4 video file. But if you need to reduce the size of your video file and improve load time_co_ then a setting of 500 can work with a bit less quality. So I encourage you to test until you are familiar enough with your playback quality on multiple mobile devices. For .webm and .ogv video files I have found that If I_t_m using a value of 1000 Kbps for my MP4 file coversion in Handbrake_co_ that to produce a similar quality for .webm and .ogv in playback_co_ that I require a Kbps rate higher than what I_t_m setting for conversion in Handbake. So if I use a setting of 1000 Kbps for my MP4 file in Handbrake_co_ to produce similar quality video playback on mobile devices_co_ I need to set a Kbps setting of at least twice what the MP4 bitrate was set to - which is a value of 2000Kbps or greater_co_ as the compression of these two video formats is greater than the MP4 video file format. So I recommend you experiment to familiarize yourself with these setting first._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_E..  _qt__lt_em_gt_Quality_lt_/em_gt__qt_ which is a value between 0 and 10 with 10 being the highest quality setting and 0 almost unusable. Again_co_ I encourage experimentation as this setting depends on how high you want the compression to be on disk and in playback. And again_co_ if you want to lower the size of your video file_co_ then a setting of 5 will also contribute to this._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_F.  I set the _qt__lt_em_gt_Keyframe interval_qt__lt_/em_gt_ to a default setting of 64_co_ as I have found this a reliable setting - although I have not had time to experiment with this setting as of yet._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_G.  I leave all other video options as is_co_ except to set 2 pass ending on as this will process your compression more evenly over the length of the entire video file._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_H.  For the Audio options_co_ I leave everything at it_t_s default_co_ unless I need to set my Channels to Mono to match my MP4 video conversion. Otherwise_co_ like the MP4 conversion_co_ I recommend only choosing either Stereo or Mono as the setting._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And that is it - just hit the _qt__lt_em_gt_Encode_lt_/em_gt__qt_ button and you are finished with either the .webm file format or the .ogv file format. Once you have encoded one of these formats_co_ then repeat using the same setting to convert to the other format as you wil require both .webm and .ogv video files for full mobile device compatibility. The only other action you will need to do is make certain that the file extension for the .ogv video file is _qt__lt_em_gt_.ogv_lt_/em_gt__qt_ (ogg)_co_ as the file will most likely be named with an .ogg file extension_co_ and you will be calling an .ogv video file in your script._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Now just make sure that in your script you are calling all 3 video file formats as in the following scipt example_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_em_gt_var videoTexture _eq_ new BABYLON.VideoTexture(_qt_video_qt__co_ [_qt_textures/Dora.mp4_qt__co_ _qt_textures/Dora.webm_qt__co_ _qt_textures/Dora.ogv_qt_]_co_ scene_co_ true_co_ true)_sm__lt_/em_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This should support video and audio playback and compatiblity for almost all desktop and mobile devices. It has worked on every device I and others have tested thus far_co_ so I hope this helps and that no one else has to waste countless hours aimlessly troubleshooting and experimenting with conversion tools_co_ video settings_co_ and testing on devices as I have these past weeks. But please keep in mind that on many mobile devices_co_ these settings have tested out - but file size is key - the larger your file size_co_ the longer it will take to load and play. So wait for your object with the videoTexture to appear_co_ and it will take a few more seconds to initiate play either from a command in your script_co_ or a button in your GUI - just be patient_co_ and the video WILL play.

The more control you have over these parameters and over your video file the better. And using the absolute lowest video resolution to achieve the required quality in your scene and the resulting file size determines if your video plays within 2 seconds or takes 30 seconds to load and play - and I_t_ve found that the differences in a video file don_t_t need to be very different to cause a huge delay in playback._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So if you_t_re experiencing a delay beyond a few seconds (depending on resolution and length of video_co_ of course)_co_ then I recommend testing all settings which will provide you with a smaller video file size without sacrificing much quallity. So keep using whatever works for you - however_co_ I have certainly come across many video applications which are not compatible with many or some mobile devices - such as writing .ogv and webm file from Vegas_co_ although now I_t_ve been able to find settings using Sony Vegas to write an MP4 file which pays fine on mobile devices.
