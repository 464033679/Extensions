It_t_s simply called _qt_SPACE GAME!_qt_ for now_co_ and it_t_s exactly what it sounds like... a space sim_co_ akin to _lt_em_gt_Cosmic Rift_lt_/em_gt_ and _lt_em_gt_Freelancer_lt_/em_gt_. It has no actual models or textures yet (because I still haven_t_t gotten around to figuring out how to properly import them) but the game logic is coming along well. I_t_m trying to go along the Minecraft model and have every world be seamlessly single player and multiplayer_co_ so even playing alone requires a server right now. This makes it awfully complicated_co_ but down the line it_t_ll be easier and make sense._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The server is _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/cyle/spacegame-server_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_here_lt_/a_gt_ and the client is _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/cyle/spacegame-client_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_here_lt_/a_gt_. I_t_ve written instructions on how to get it running locally (found _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/cyle/spacegame-client/blob/master/USAGE.md_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_here_lt_/a_gt_) since I do not yet have a server running anywhere for this_co_ just a local virtual machine. Getting it up and running is a bit tough at the moment_co_ and there_t_s not much to do once it_t_s going_co_ but it_t_s a work in progress. I wanted to open source it from the get-go just in case I don_t_t finish it. Maybe someone else down the line can take it further or learn something from it._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_As for Babylon.JS -- it_t_s been by far the easiest engine to use. I originally tried writing this game in Processing_co_ then Processing.js_co_ then in C++ using the Cinder library_co_ and then using a few HTML5 2D engines. For some reason Babylon has been the easiest for me to understand and utilize_co_ despite the lack of API documentation. My profession is systems architecture and programming with stuff like PHP_co_ Bash_co_ Node.js_co_ Ruby_co_ Python_co_ and Go_co_ and I_t_ve never fully gotten into C/C++ so I haven_t_t found them as useful and robust as plain old javascript._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Anyway_co_ I_t_ll post in here any substantial updates that come along. And I_t_m happy to use the forum to help out other people who are trying to do things with Babylon._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2013-10-19T05:50:22Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_This is excellent!
