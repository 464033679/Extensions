By using more images in the texture map it would be possible to apply different areas of the image to different walls. An alternative would be to build the interior walls as separate and individual polygon meshes kept together by a mutual parent and each with its own material. You could do something similar with the exterior walls and then you could have different textures on different exterior walls.
