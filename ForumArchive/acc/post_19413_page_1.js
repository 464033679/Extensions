And the best feature of Blender is that it is free. However_co_ as I often do_co_ I will quickly chime in and let you know that in using all of the afore mentined character applictions and scene pipelines_co_ I personally find the very best results using Motionbuilder and the .fbx file fomat prior to exporting to the .babylon file format for use in babylon.js._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But there is a cost to purchase Motionbuilder_co_ and users such as gryff and othrs are finding very good results from Blender and plugins for Blender such as MakeHuman. But I thought I_t_d at least provide you with what I_t_ve personally found to be the best_co_ simplest_co_ and fastest option for me_co_ simply for your consideration. But there are several good and valid options available_co_ and they will do everthing you require to produce your game. So you_t_ll hear of mny of these in the coming days_co_ and shuld be able to make a valid decision in short time. Just please keep Motionbuilder and FBX in the recesses of your mind_co_ and perhaps give it a try if you get the chance_co_ You can always download the 30 day trial version_co_ and spend nothing to see if this might be a good solution for your needs._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But as mentioned above_co_ there are several good solutions out there with many users on this forum who can guide you through the process and asist you with any issues you might run into._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
