The support for Windows Mixed Reality came after. So you don_t_t have to worry about Oculus/HTC support. You can even simulate a HTC Vive in Firefox using your Windows MR HMD by installing SteamVR and the Windows Mixed Reality bridge from Stream. It won_t_t work as well as a real HTC Vive but can be useful to have an idea of your code running in this environment.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tRegarding performance and stability_co_ for now_co_ only Firefox has an official WebVR support on desktop. It_t_s pretty stable as I_t_d say at least as performant as in Edge if not better. Chrome has the best performance specifically when you have a lot of draw calls but WebVR is not yet officially supported.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs you said_co_ the beauty of WebVR and web technologies is that this is supposed to run everywhere. Everybody knows this is not - that - simple and that_t_s why Babylon.js is taking care of a lot of details for you behind the hood. So you can be confident in the fact that using Babylon.js WebVR features_co_ your code will run on as much platforms as possible. The team is spending time validating the code on them.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe main important point will be the performance of the device targeted. Of course_co_ a scene like Sponza made for high-end HMD / desktop won_t_t run well on mobile WebVR devices. I_t_ve tested on a Samsung S8 / GearVR for instance and the scene is too complex for this device. That_t_s why we often see very simple scenes with low poly created for a mobile first experiences. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ve tried to cover a little bit this topic in this article on my blog_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.davrous.com/2017/07/07/from-zero-to-hero-creating-webvr-experiences-with-babylon-js-on-all-platforms/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.davrous.com/2017/07/07/from-zero-to-hero-creating-webvr-experiences-with-babylon-js-on-all-platforms/_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDavid\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"HoloLite","Date":"2018-02-27T19:02:07Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5482-davrous/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_5482_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/5482-davrous/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@davrous_lt_/a_gt_ Thanks for the response.
