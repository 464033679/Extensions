Anyone remember Steel Battalion for Xbox with almost 50 controls_co_ button_co_ and even an in game discrete frequency radio for communication and cranking the tunes (with a slight modification.) gamepad.js allow easy access to the Gampad API_co_ and optimizes the amount of code necessary to call key functions such as polling (detecting) what controllers are plugged into any device_co_ as well as return a null value if there is no controller currently plugged into the device. And if you choose_co_ this one simple function which you can run in a loop_co_ returns the state of every button and control on the controller for every controller on the list - which is invaluable to be able to set control values for controllers you have personally never seen before - and the same function detects when a controller is plugged in_co_ the state of all buttons_co_ and the mapping of all buttons.

However_co_ like the Oculus contollers_co_ you have limited controls_co_ which for me is a huge disadvantage as a developer_co_ as the odds that any product I release will be purchased by someone who owns the HTC Vive_co_ is minimal.

Congratulations on getting your Vive_co_ as this would have been my personal choice if it were not for my development needs. I don_t_t believe it_t_s much of a stretch to say that the Vive beats Oculus hands down for quality. However_co_ only time will tell if the Oculus user experience won_t_t dramatically exceed the abilities of the Vive - especially with the Samsung VR and other licenses coming to market this year. And if using an S6 or S7 with the GearVR_co_ the resolution is fantastic - with virtually no pixelation due to the 2550 X resolution on both phones. Regardless_co_ the Vive is allot of good fun_sm_ but the Oculus isn_t_t far behind in image quality anymore_co_ and will most likely sell 4 to 1 if you consider all licensing.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"davrous","Date":"2016-06-09T19:10:16Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_11286_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/11286-dbawel/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@dbawel_lt_/a_gt__co_ thanks for this great feedback.

Maybe a ViveController wrapper class would be useful ? what do you think?\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t know how large the user base will be for Vive_co_ but depending on this_co_ a class specific to the Vive might have great potential - not only for the vive_co_ but as an example for other controllers as they have more in common with one another than thy do as seperate devices. And for quick testing_co_ take a look at Intel_t_s XDK. Also_co_ to quickly plug in your VIve controllers into a windows device_co_ try using zeemouse for Android as it works virtually as well on Android as it does on Windows.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd to understand how similar the available VR controllers are to Vive controllers_co_ take a look at the following link_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.destructoid.com/guide-how-to-make-a-dirt-cheap-steam-vr-headset-with-low-lag-358924.phtml_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.destructoid.com/guide-how-to-make-a-dirt-cheap-steam-vr-headset-with-low-lag-358924.phtml_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs this will provide you with enough _qt_fun_qt_ for an entire weekend in developing your own controllers and control systems for most any VR device or headset_co_ as well as assist in a much better understanding of how VR controllers intrface with existing headsets.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope you check this out_co_ as it will provide you with a crash course in VR controllers as well as to accellerate your overall understanding of VR_co_ orientation_co_ and controllers which there is nowhere to go these days as this is still a brand new frontier in trying to set some sort of standards for VR_co_ VR devices_co_ and VR headsets.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHave Fun - always!_lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_lol_dd__qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_laugh.png_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_lol_dd__qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
