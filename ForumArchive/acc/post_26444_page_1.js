We have tried researching and testing our way forward but frankly_co_ we_t_ve hit a bit of a stop.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tA little backstory_dd_ we are working together with a big company and their internal web application to show system hierarchy and dependencies. Our mission is to take this web application_co_ currently running in 2D_co_ and bring it into 3D. We are all computer scientist with little to no previous knowledge of 3D so it has been quite the learning experience but babylon has been a wonderful tool to work with to make this happend.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFirst of all_co_ we are representing the different systems using meshes(spheres). This works well_co_ however this is a big company with ALOT of different systems and the searches can return up to 10 000 different systems in one view. This means we have to draw 10 000 spheres connected with a couple of thousand lines. This causes lag! We started looking into performance optimization and stumbled across making instances of the spheres instead of creating new ones. In our test we could see a significant increase in FPS when doing so but we ran into another problem. The application we are developing has to be able to click and select the different spheres to display information about them and to interact with them. When we applied the instances on our application clicking one of the meshes selected all meshes of the same instance. The question here being is this the intended and expected behaviour or can we work around it somehow?_lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tWe tried cloning the meshes but the FPS increase was nowhere near the same as with instances.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAny other help on how to improve performance with something like this is much appriciated_co_ sorry we can_t_t provide you with a playground or something but hopefully the question makes sense!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBr_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tJohan\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jerome","Date":"2016-11-17T13:44:20Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMaybe instead spheres (what look spheric wherever you look them from)_co_ you could use discs_co_ particles or sprites_co_ well 2D shapes.
