I_t_ve been a big fan of TypeScript and am just starting to build a new game with this awesome engine. My workflow is based on npm_co_ but it seems the latest npm distribution (v2.5) is missing files like babylon.2.5.canvas2d.d.ts. Is it missed by accident_co_ or are you planing to publish it in a separate package? At present I have to clone the hole repository for that file.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBTW_co_ is it okay to compile the source with the _qt_noImplicitAny_qt_ flag?
