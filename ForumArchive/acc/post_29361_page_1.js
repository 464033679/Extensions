I was used to write my own shader code there and the material still received lighting and shadows.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat is the correct way to do it here? When I use the ShaderMaterial_co_ only my shaders are used. I could probably copy&amp_sm_paste all the stuff from the default material in there_co_ but I didn_t_t have much success as I would have to set some defines and bind some stuff during the onBind call_co_ if I understood it correctly.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI could also write a whole new material. Then at least everything would be a little bit more clean_co_ but I would still have to copy&amp_sm_paste a lot of things.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDid I miss something entirely? What_t_s with this ShaderBuilder I read a little bit about but doesn_t_t seem to be bundled to BJS? What is the recommended way of creating a new shader with lights and shadows?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tÂ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-03-28T17:29:53Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHello and welcome!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe best option if you want to get all features (including bones_co_ shadows_co_etc..) would be to create a custom material.
