One file is called Room and it is just a basic layout of a room (door_co_ window_co_ closet door). The other file is called RoomContent and as the title specifies it has the basic contents of a room (bed_co_ dresser_co_ toy chest and a computer workstation). What I want to do is be able to do is load these two scenes at the same time and give the illusion to the users that it is just one scene. I know that in Unity 3D you can call a function called _qt_load level additive_qt_ and it would bring two levels or _qt_scenes_qt_ loaded at the same time. Can I do this in babylon.js?
