The _qt_relationship_qt_ of the camera to the box... remains consistent.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI believe the problem with _qt_blind spots_qt_ and _qt_everything disappears_qt_ is caused by camera.minZ.  Set camera.minZ to a very small float value_co_ or even 0_co_ and perhaps... no more blind spots and disappearing.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tGenerally speaking_co_ most people don_t_t parent their camera to a mesh that gets scaled.  Often_co_ to keep the camera WITH the player_co_ folks will use a targetCamera or followCamera_co_ or set camera.lockedTarget _eq_ player.  Sometimes_co_ people put camera.setTarget(player.position)... inside the render loop_co_ so the camera is constantly watching the player.  There are many ways to get a camera to stay-with a player... WITHOUT parenting the camera to the player.  Perhaps you should try those other ways.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tUse our _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/playground_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_playground search_lt_/a_gt_ to search for followCamera.  It should return many hits.  Also_co_ check out lines 207-208 of _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#LYCSQ%23256_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_this fine playground_lt_/a_gt_... for some fancy _qt_following arcCamera_qt_ code.  It uses _qt_Lerp_qt_ which is an abbreviation for linear interpolation.  (You probably knew that already).  \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPersonally_co_ I would use the _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/search?q_eq_followCamera_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_followCamera or ArcFollowCamera_lt_/a_gt_.  It has lots of power_co_ and some nice _qt_easing_qt_ (smoothing-out camera-following of fast turns done by players).  Generally speaking_co_ always try to move the camera _lt_strong_gt__lt_u_gt_target_lt_/u_gt__lt_/strong_gt_ WITH the player_co_ or have the player be the camera_t_s .lockedTarget_co_ or things like that.  Perhaps_co_ try to avoid parenting the camera to the player mesh_co_ especially if that mesh will be changing scale.  I think followCamera will work good for you.  It_t_s like a _qt_camera trailer hitch_qt_ for pulling a camera behind your player.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  (with no scaling inheritance problems).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ll be here... if you want to talk more.  Ping me_co_ as wanted.  That is done by typing @wing in a post_co_ and then choosing _t_wingnut_t_ from the small list of names that opens.  Others are nearby_co_ too.  Be patient with yourself and try to have fun.  It takes some time to play with all the camera types_co_ but I think you will be happy with the available options.
