This might be a little naive_co_ so let_t_s see how this goes._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_I am using octrees and messed around with the Scene Optimization stuff_co_ but am still trying to understand all of my options for improving performance_co_ here are some key things that come to mind_co_ that I can_t_t find the info on or having troubles finding it_dd__lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_1) View distance of camera_dd_ I have seen some examples that are able to not show anything beyond a certain point (appears to be a radius)._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_2) Better understanding of how to make my own options with the ScenenOptimizer. I know it stated in the Tutorial_co_ but an example of making custom options and implementing would be helpful. For example_co_ creating something between Low and Medium Degradation_co_ etc._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_3) Are there any complied techniques on optimizing scenes or Do_t_s and Don_t_ts. For example if I have multiple meshes that do not move in the scene_co_ does merging them improve performance or anything like that?_lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_An overall performance guide to utilizing Babylon.js would be really awesome. I wish I knew more of the fine detail_co_ but I_t_ve yet to take a leap into the code (not sure where to start haha)._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_What comes to mind is the classic graphic settings in video games. I understand some of that is baked into the implementation and not the Babylon framework_co_ such as providing different poly meshes using LOD and what not. This is my attempt to understand what Babylon.js already has built in._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_Thank you!_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2014-12-09T19:36:46Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_div_gt_You ask all the features babylon has? it_t_s hard to answer that kind of question.
