I recently took on a project which as briefly described to me seemed simple enough. Although it was a very short schedule to deliver. One week prior_co_ a key developer _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_19199_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Pryme8_lt_/a_gt_ who is often seen on this forum offered to show me how I might optimize code I had posted previously_co_ and I thought to reach out to him directly.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWithin the first week_co_ I learned that the scope of the project was far in advance of the initial description. Thus_co_ I instictively knew that I would not be able to deliver the project on time_co_ and also lacked some of the fundamental experience required to complete the project on schedule. So I reached out to _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_19199_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Pryme8_lt_/a_gt__co_ and asked if he had time to assist. He was on another project at the time_co_ but was free for one week before my delivery to assist with my project. I_t_m happy to say that the delivery is now happening this week_co_ and not only was he able to assist_co_ but I learned much from working directly with him. Not to mention_co_ his code is as close to perfection as I_t_ve ever seen - but that_t_s perhaps for another post.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo what I hope to come from this post_co_ is that we are always stronger working together_co_ as is the world of open source_co_ and if you ever have the opportunity to work with _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_19199_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Pryme8_lt_/a_gt_ (I_t_ll with hold his real name for now)I highly recommend you jump at the chance.
