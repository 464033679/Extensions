For example_co_ if I wanted to create thousands of towers of blocks at random_co_ and test if they were balanced or unbalanced (i.e. that they would stay upright on their own_co_ even under the influence of gravity) I could do that with what I know of Babylon right now_co_ but it would require leaving it to run for a very long time. Is there a way to have it step through the world state without needing to render to the screen_co_ and without taking as long as a frame ordinarily would?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-10-16T23:42:30Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYes you can do that.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tJust manually call the function you need (like create all your blocks_co_ call mesh.computeWorldMatrix_co_ etc..)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf no need to render then you can do all that you want manually\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Azariel","Date":"2018-10-26T04:11:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo assuming that I have 5 blocks in the world initially set to be in mid-air and there is gravity_co_ if I call _qt_mesh.computeWorldMatrix_qt_ on all of them 10 times_co_ they will all have moved downward the equivalent of 10 frames?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-10-26T16:14:41Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNope but if you call scene.render() multiple times it will work\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
