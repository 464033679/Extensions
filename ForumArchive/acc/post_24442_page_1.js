I would like to create a visual representation of my college_co_ but it doesn_t_t need to have complex detailing_co_ only doors_co_ windows_co_ and walls. In fact_co_ it doesn_t_t need to offer ways to enter each room_co_ it just has to provide a way to know what a particular room is for such as a lab or regular room_co_ etc_co_ you get the idea. I need an interactive tool to traverse the building and point_co_ with mouse clicking_co_ what that place is for. The furthermost goal is to add GPS to detect where they should go based on coordinates much like a regular GPS device_co_ while providing a free aerial camera but blocking going through walls. It_t_s for exploring the place itself._lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tI know it_t_s quite too much_co_ but if you_t_re interested in helping please send me a message over pcf.feat at gmail dot com.
