However_co_ my company has an app that_t_s going into beta which perfectly syncs all media precisely in all HTML5 browsers¬†in real time for an¬†unlimited number of users collaborating together with generally less than 5ms delay in interaction... internationally... on average_co_ of course_co_ depending on your connection.. We_t_re still working on the API to the server (Brains) - don_t_t know when we_t_ll release the API for the server... however if you want to test what we_t_ve done_co_ let me know if you want to apply for the beta release. You won_t_t find anything that a good JS Dev can build as it_t_s mostly written in PHP ( a royal challenge)_co_ and we also use two servers. One is the brains and the other holds the media and database... so it_t_s completely secure for the media and the brains of it all - which was our challenge for the film and broadcast industry. It_t_s like Photoshop online in real time for any media and unlimited users.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tA reply to this message won_t_t trigger my memory to add you to the beta list_co_ however we deploy in two weeks to Weta in NZ_co_ Blue Man Productions_co_ and a division of Lockheed Martin_co_ as we also sync collaborative 3D media in real time. So I_t_ve got my hands full right now. But I_t_ll try and post a topic to those who might be the best to test the app. It_t_s not all WebGL... only when you launch collaborative 3D media_co_ but we_t_ve spent more than 5+ years building the server and more than 2 years building the application. However we_t_re only 2 developers_co_ with a little help from our friend to get us into PHP ( _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_19199_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Pryme8_lt_/a_gt_¬†... reclusive bastard_co_ you made my life hell - but I now know PHP_co_ so I guess I owe you)... and I will call you (Andy) this week.
