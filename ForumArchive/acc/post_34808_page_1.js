I achieved a lot with Babylon JS without the need of posting anywhere_co_ because you get all the information you need just by one simple google search.

Everything works great so far_co_ I made controls to reposition_co_ scale_co_ rotate_co_ change color etc. to decals and they can be placed simply by clicking on the desired position. The problem is with bigger sizes_dd_ As I understand_co_ decals not getting mapped onto the UV but projected onto the mesh. If I want to place a big picture and scale it up or place a long line of text_co_ there a limitations_dd_ The picture can_t_t run all way around the ball_co_ because it get_t_s cut off at a certain point. The second problem is_co_ that it get_t_s stretched at the outer parts (the more it is away from the clicked center_co_ the more it is stretched_co_ since it get_t_s projected onto a sphere). \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_TL_sm_DR_dd__lt_/strong_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tIs there any way to place decals so they don_t_t get stretched but use the UV (which is there since I dynamically load textures for the ball) to place them _qt_pixel-perfect_qt_ all around the ball_co_ if necessary (or at least half the ball)?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you guys and a happy New Year _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2018-01-02T02:32:22Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHey_co_ happy new year_co_ AB_co_ and welcome to the forum.  It is a little sleepy here_co_ lately_co_ eh?  Sorry.  Here in the USA where I am_co_ everyone is busy trying to thaw the champagne so they can toast the new year.  It_t_s SO cold_co_ most have resorted to cutting-up the bubbly into bite-size chunks... with chain saws.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYeah_co_ decals... phew... have you ever looked at the code for decals?  _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Mesh/babylon.meshBuilder.ts#L1030_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/src/Mesh/babylon.meshBuilder.ts#L1030_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tJust a pile of tumor-causing math_co_ eh?  *nod*   That_t_s cuzzzzzzz... decals are special.  The are _qt_mesh-contour-sensing_qt_ at creation time (but no automatic contour-updating when/if moved onto different surface contours later_co_ post-creation.)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tGiven that decals are angle-sensing at creation-time (so they can _qt_bend_qt_ to match mesh surface contour _lt_em_gt_somewhat_lt_/em_gt_)... they also have some understandable and justified limitations.  One of those limitations... is seen when a decal has to contour to an angle/corner nearing 90 degrees.  You can REALLY see how decals act... better... if you set your decal.showBoundingBox _eq_ true_sm_  THEN you can see the _qt_hell_qt_ that the decal_lt_u_gt_Mesh_lt_/u_gt_ goes-thru... to make its material act any-what decal-like.  Decals are not easy.  They are an advanced feature_co_ and somewhat specialized for certain tasks only.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYOU_co_ my friend... have hit a natural limit of decals.  So_co_ as you have speculated... it might be time to move-on to a new way of accomplishing your goals.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI believe... your solution is with using Babylon_t_s DynamicTexture.  There_t_s _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/playground?code_eq_dynamicTexture_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_many playground demos_lt_/a_gt_ that use them.  Their primary purpose was to draw text on textures_co_ and later in BJS history_co_ Babylon GUI was invented_co_ and made that task even easier_co_ using a different method.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut dynamicTexture lives-on_co_ because of another thing that is at its heart... the _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_W3C context2d_lt_/a_gt_ world.  It is essentially...
