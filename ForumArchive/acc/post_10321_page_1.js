(you can simply use _qt_bird.lookAt(waypointArray[current])_qt_ for this the Mesh.lookAt function will automatically orient your bird every step)_lt_br_gt_So up until now your bird will simply fly from point A to Point B while automatically looking at it. Next you need to do some RayCasting_co_ create a Ray originating from yout Birds momentary position and Aiming to its forward position (that you calculated at the beginning already). if the Ray will hit anything (and it really should since we are looking at the next waypoint) you can measure the distance to it. And if the distance get_t_s small enough simply move on to the next waypoint in your list by adding +1 to your counter variable. Now the bird will look at your next waypoint any if you move it to the waypoint instead of it_t_s forward it will also automatically move there._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Of course check before adding +1 to your counter variable if the counter variable +1 will be &gt_sm_ than the Array count ... and if it would set it back to 0_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_... now for objects that are no waypoints but still get picked up by the raycasting you can perform several actions_co_ one possibility is to make the bird perform a sine  based curve around the object_co_ another would be to add an intermediate waypoint on demand._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Create an angle variable and a boolean then in the same function in which you cast the ray_co_ evaluate the hit result and check if it is one of your waypoints_co_ if not_co_ check if a certain range to the _t_obstacle_t_ has been reached_co_ if so_co_ set your boolean to true_co_ now an if statement should encapsule your whole function and if the boolean value you just created is true only the else statement should be carried out in it you will perform the following steps_dd_ create a new local Vector3 the Vectors x position will be the distance the bird should remain from the object multiplyed by the Sinus of the angle variable (I am not sure what the exact init-value for the angle would be_co_ but it would probably be -90*Math.PI/180) and the Vectors z position will be the distance times the Cosinus of the angle (!!! If you are planning on having your angle variable represent actual degrees_co_ you have to multily it with _qt_Math.PI/180_qt_ before calculating the Sinus or Cosinus) now after every step the bird will perform in that manner_co_ you have to raise the angle value by a bit until it reaches its original vaule +180° then return to the original functionalty where the bird just faces the next waypoint by setting your boolean to false again._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_another option would be to just create nother waypoint at the same position the hit is found_co_ but then offsetting it by a little ..._lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_wow ... that got WAY too long...
