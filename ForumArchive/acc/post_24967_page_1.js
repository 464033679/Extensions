The person who_t_s turn it is_co_ will have figure that out and continue the project how ever they see fit.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\twhen you submit the playground link for your turn there can be no compiler errors this means if you have to not finish your function so an error does not drop then that_t_s just what it is_co_ let_t_s hope the next person picks up your flow.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tthe end result being_co_ hell I don_t_t know...
