I found that we actually don_t_t need any of those to run a BJS app natively at iOS because since its 8.+ version they have a nice WKWebView component that performs well for webGL_co_ and also works ok with webAudio using a hack with events to trigger sound._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_ve created an example .xproject with one of the playground demos running_co_ the code is still hacky and i will refactor it in the future_co_ but its just a nice example of an easy wrapper that should work with other js frameworks too.
