Even with Safari_t_s tireless console reporting_co_ there is absolutely nothing out of place.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo...  I just now tested in IE on 2 different Windows OS and not a single error in IE running at 42fps and 48fps respectively on 2 dated laptops. So as I mentioned last night_co_ The scene is running well - and I see where it _qt_might_qt_ appear that you are attaching an imposter to a null_co_ but there is no problem with doing this_co_ as I built a test scene and generated a mesh imposter for it and it_t_s children_co_ and no errors. So if your client is still claiming to have issues_co_ then it is their hardware and/or OS and/or browser - or some other problem unique to them - since after testing on 5 different hardware devices and systems_co_ and 5 browsers including 2 different versions of IE_co_ your scene performs flawlessly.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs a friend_co_ it_t_s beginning to piss me off now as well_co_ as you know it is an issue with their hardware and/or software - as we_t_ve now shown it to work on every possible standard configuration including Opera for God_t_s Sake_sm_ and several other hacked configs where I limited browser memory_co_ forced proxy settings_co_ and anything else which might break any _qt_simple_qt_ scene - and not a ball buster like you_t_ve built for them - and your scene is rock solid! You haven_t_t and don_t_t need to say who the client is_co_ but they have an issue_co_ not you. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo if you still have this problem with the client tomorrow_co_ simply ask and we can send them the link to your scene on my server - and it_t_ll be a quick conversation.
