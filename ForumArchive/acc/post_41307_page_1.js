However I am not able to free appropriately the memory. I did a profile with Chrome_t_s built-in tool. Please see my screenshot. It seems that all the objects related my Viewer has been deleted. But I have bunch of objects in BABYLON module which are not deleted. Does anyone has ideas about how to delete all these stuff? Is the memory about the script (imported BABYLON module) itself?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21002_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/image.png.ac19c43e55d38aac96874a2c12e4d69e.png_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt_image.thumb.png.8b8e772eaa12d6a21e71953885b8793e.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_21002_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_11/image.thumb.png.8b8e772eaa12d6a21e71953885b8793e.png_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-11-16T15:56:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is likely the code itself.
