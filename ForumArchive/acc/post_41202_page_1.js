It takes some learning and there_t_s no getting around that but there are lots of great resources online to learn. For 2D _qt_pixel art_qt_ sprites you can use Photoshop or _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.gimp.org/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_The GIMP_lt_/a_gt_Â or _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//krita.org/en/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Krita_lt_/a_gt_Â but Babylon.js is more of a 3D engine than a 2D engine although it does have support for _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/sprites_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_2D sprites_lt_/a_gt_.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2) Any device or web browser that supports javascript and WebGL ... see _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//caniuse.com/#feat_eq_webgl_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Can I Use WebGL_lt_/a_gt_Â but performance will vary depending on the complexity of your game and the hardware that it_t_s running on.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t3) Babylon.js is a 3D engine and doesn_t_t explicitly handle things like multiplayer or game logic - you need to handle that stuff yourself and there_t_s many options depending on your game_t_s genre and desired gameplay etc. See _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//colyseus.io/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Colyseus_lt_/a_gt_ for one multiplayer option that works nicely with Bablylon.js\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t4) Unity and Babylon.js are both good but are satisfying different niches IMO - Babylon.js excels at web-based 3D games and applications and because it_t_s written in typescript/javascript it means you can seamlessly integrate with the plethora of other web-based frameworks and technologies that are out there e.g. Node.js_co_ React_co_ Angular_co_ jQuery_co_ HTML_co_ CSSÂ etc. If you_t_re wanting to create standalone executables for PC_co_ Mac and consoles then Unity might be a better choice although you can package up web applications like Babylon.js games for console also if you need to. For example_co_ I_t_m working on a SaaS application that integrates Drupal CMS (PHP_co_ MySQL)_co_ Babylon.js and Colyseus.js/Node.js - this would be much harder to do in Unity.
