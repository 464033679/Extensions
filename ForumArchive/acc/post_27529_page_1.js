On mobile at moment so cannot test my idea. When you create box no material is applied to the box so a default shading is given. When you use toMesh this supplies a material as a parameter_co_ in this case a new standard material which seems to apply a different default shading to the one when no material is set. Try creating a material and applying it to the box when created and the same material as the parameter in toMesh. If I am correct the shading of the box before and after csg is used should not change.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Edemsky","Date":"2017-01-08T17:04:20Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_158149_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_27529_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1483892544_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_14282_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_JohnK_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t37 minutes ago_co_ JohnK said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tHi.
