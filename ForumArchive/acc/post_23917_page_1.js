Internally I can tell you that they don_t_t expect to come close to their sales and licensing projections_co_ and expect that they will take a huge loss overall in 2016 and 2017 is looking very poor. I_t_m writing this as you might know that I have not been a huge proponent of Oculus since I know their technology well as they based it upon my old company_t_s technology EmersionST as the founder was a PA there. Although_co_ I have to say that he was and is a very talented artist and person_co_ and has built Oculus into as good of a product as was possible considering his personal background.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo I wanted to caution anyone who might be developing games/content for the Oculus_co_ and counting on sales from users of this specific device. A good friend of mine sold his company to Sony 3 years ago_co_ and they are pushing hard with fantastic game titles for the Playstation VR display upon release - where Oculus will not be able to compete with content or in display quality. And all other VR and AR amnufacturers - especially Sony and Microsoft - have a far better product with greater functionality as well as content - not to mention the compatability of Xbox and Playstation. And specifically_co_ Microsoft_t_s Hololens is in my opinion the very best VR - and more importantly - AR experience prior to the retina projector head-mounted displays due to hit the market by 2018 (according to the deepest secret inner circles of trust.)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis doesn_t_t mean that you shouldn_t_t be developing for Oculus_co_ but to mke certain that your content is also compatible with Vive and all other VR displays - which fortunately should be the case if using babylon.js - as it_t_s simply a camera change - and I have advised checking out the gamepad.js API as it is a universal script which has more features than you might ever consider using_co_ and solves any controller issues we might have_co_ not to mention full backwards compatability - and will save you tons of time in controller detections_co_ unique user setup_co_ etc.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo for me personally_co_ I_t_m developing content for Oculus (GearVR specifically) as it is providing me with invaluable experience for when VR and more specifically AR really takes off - which will happen next year. I just wanted to provide my own personal insight for those who might be developing games and/or content for Oculus and Vive - and relying on the potential for a return on revenue from all of your hard work. Again_co_ this is simply my own personal opinion_co_ however_co_ I_t_m affiliated with a very high profile retina projection display company_co_ as well as the premiere content creator for this device - not to mention a best friend who is a key administrtor and engineer at Sony SCE. Thus as I read more and more developer_t_s posts asking questions on a much higher level for the development of games for Oculus_co_ Vive_co_ etc._co_ I am concerned that there might be considerable work currently being done (or considered) to develop content for such devices_co_ which I personally don_t_t believe there would be any possibility of a reasonable (or even un-reasonable) return on investment for the developer at this time or in the near future. Once Playstation and Hololens are released_co_ Oculus is practically over - in every industry study.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI wrote a similar answer to a post about a year ago to let developers on this site know that my sources clearly told me that even in 2015_co_ Zuckerburg was extremely unhappy about his purchase of Oculus - as well as concerned about the potential damage the device can produce on the human eye. Now more than a year later_co_ Zuckerburg has all but distanced himself from Oculus with the exception of his contractual obligations to his investment company. I hope those of you who read this at the time heeded the warning_co_ but this has now come home to roost_co_ and Oculus is already scrambling their marketting_co_ PR_co_ and advertizing teams to try and salvage whatever they can to minimize losses. They_t_re even running discounts on hardware and software even though the product is practically brand new for the consumer models release.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe good news is that all of the experience developers are gaining right now using these devices will be invaluable for fiture devices - as working in VR and AR is a very different world in which to create as a developer. Google cardboard would be my choice if I wanted to learn the ins and outs of VR and AR. And there will be loads of jobs for any developer for Playstation and Hololens in the very near future. And for the retina projectors - it_t_s all relative_co_ as 80% of the current development experience will be invaluable_co_ and these devices will change the world as we know it - which those who know me on this forum knows I_t_ve been preaching this for a couple of years now. They just can_t_t yet grasp how dramatically these devices will change the world as we know it almost overnight. Also_co_ take a look at the new projectors which will be released next year which project 180 to 360 degrees in a room (immersis as an example) - as these are really cool as well. Not to mention the highly secretive film surfaces (materials to stick on walls) and electrically reactive paint which turns any room into a virtual space.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tObviously_co_ we_t_ll not worry about these things yet_co_ and continue to make great content using this fantastic framework called babylon.js. But for personal reasons I_t_m also using this framework as I know it will not become obsolete_co_ but in the future will also be a serious player in the VR and AR space - even in the realm of retina projection displays. I just wanted to make certain that I try and provide the community with what I_t_m aware of uniquely_co_ and that I hope you don_t_t - or haven_t_t decided to place your bets on Oculus - as so many companies already have and are already regretting it. I was in so many meetings last year where I was called in to consult on whether an investment group should invest in a VR company for the now released VR devices. And I advised against investment for VR on the currently released devices in almost every case_co_ and was ignored in almost every case. However_co_ I recently began receiving somewhat desperate emails from several of the investors asking what I believe the future might hold_co_ as their latest projections now show them taking a very big loss. But for you and I_co_ we_t_re all in a very good place right now_sm_ and if you_t_re new to babylon.js_co_ you DEFINATELY made the right choice._lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSorry to rain on anyone_t_s parade_co_ and I truly do not like to be the bearer of any bad news. However_co_ I just received the most depressing email I_t_ve received in a while from a former collegue and invester in VR_co_ and his regrets are beyond what I might have imagined - as he and his company bet highly on the current state and the future progress of VR in the coming year. So I thought it wise to at least remind my friends what I_t_ve been warning - but more importantly_co_ what is now unfortunately coming to pass. Although VR and AR looks to have an amazing future for us all.

Think of its ability to take you away from the ever day and bring you into another world. The Oculus system was far to rich for my blood but the Samsung Gear VR which uses a phone that I can get and use for other things worked for me to dip my toe in the water. Price I think will be a huge challenge for Microsofts Hololens. Fantastic device with a phenomenal team behind it but its brutally expensive for new tech with limited purpose today. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe Samsung Gear VR must use Oculus head tracking which is phenomenal. Its fluid and just works but your ability to be involved in the game/environment is tragically not there. I have played with the Leap motion controller a bit and think something like it is a must for what I would call Augmented VR.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFrom a conceptual view I think having your hands and motion in the scene is a must for the next level of this device. If Samsung could turn on the front camera and have some sort of motion tracking or incorporate the Leap Motion (which has such cool finger movement) the device might have more life. Currently its a sit and watch device with difficult interaction since you cant see a gamepad nor do you have a sense of being in the scene. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne more note in this long winded discussion I AM EXTREMELY disappointed that WIGIG was not used to connect the Oculus_co_ WIRES?
