I_t_ve read lots of resources and tried lots of things and I still don_t_t quite know what I_t_m doing_co_ to be honest but I_t_ve stumbled upon this noob question_co_ hopefully is an easy one_co_ even though it_t_s not so obvious for me.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ I_t_m trying to build a game in which there is a character that can move around the scene. I_t_ve got a friend that is creating cool buildings with Solid Works and exporting them to STL. Managed to import them (not with pain) to BabylonJS_co_ but then got in a bit of trouble making the character _qt_interact_qt_ with the building (ie_co_ a castle_co_ I_t_ve imported it as a Mesh_co_ should I import it as scene? by the way? what would be the difference?).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway_co_ first of all_co_ I understood that you have _qt_two ways_qt_ of dealing with this_co_ either using physics_co_ or collisions. I tried first with _qt_collisionsEnabled_qt_ and _qt_moveWithCollisions_qt__co_ and I almost managed to achieve what I was looking for. My character could move and would collision with the castle_co_ I could get in through a whole (door)_co_ and all fine. The issue comes when there are stairs or a ramp_co_ I haven_t_t managed to get the character walk through them. I did a lot of research and came up with the conclusion (please tell me if I_t_m wrong) that using moveWithCollisions wouldn_t_t work for my purpose as without using Physics_co_ Babylon doesn_t_t distinguish between a wall or a stair/ramp_co_ it_t_s all a collision and hence the character cannot keep walking.  Please tell me if I_t_m wrong with any of this.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ I tried to enable physics and this is where the magic begins... my building and the character were falling through the ground_co_ and lots of crazy stuff_co_ I_t_m obviously doing something really wrong. I kind of managed to move a box towards the building but it seemed to collision very soon with the castle and I_t_ve been unable to test if it can go inside the castle and through the stairs because as soon as the character gets closer to the building it does some crazy jump and disappears_co_ I suspect might be related to the fact that I_t_ve set the castle as a BoxImpostor but I_t_m not really sure and still not very sure if I_t_m doing the right thing switching from using collisionsEnabled to enabling physics and using Oimo or Cannon_co_ which I also heard that are way more realistic but at a performance cost.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat_t_s it pretty much_co_ I_t_ve spent endless hours and haven_t_t made any progress_co_ so thought of asking for advice before investing more time to ensure at least I_t_m on the right track. Any advice would be very appreciated.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tRegards\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tJavier\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2017-02-28T09:16:21Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_165282_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_28745_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1488272761_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_25865_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_Javierl_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t7 minutes ago_co_ Javierl said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tusing moveWithCollisions wouldn_t_t work for my purpose as without using Physics_co_ Babylon doesn_t_t distinguish between a wall or a stair/ramp_co_ it_t_s all a collision and hence the character cannot keep walking. \n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ you are wrong on this one _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_ .

This is a hard (and a very rewarding) task. I would stay with the simple collision system. If there is a physics usecase in your game_co_ you can combine the two.
