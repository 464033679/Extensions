Have one question that I can_t_t seem to figure out.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhen I set up an action for an object_co_ for example change the color on pointer over_co_ change back on pointer out_co_ I set the material.diffuseColor property and the RGB values I want. This works fine and works in the exported scene_co_ but when I go back to edit the action_co_ the material.diffuseColor isn_t_t shown in the set value parameter for that item_co_ it_t_s back at the top of the drop-down menu for that item (alphaindex). This only seems to happen with the various material.X parameters_co_ and none of the other properties out of the drop-down (i.e. color overlay_co_ visibility_co_ etc).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNot a big deal when there are just one or two objects your editing parameters for and can remember what you just edited_co_ but the scene I_t_m going to work on will have lots of objects I want to script material properties for and having to reset the material.X settings each time will be impossible. I_t_ll have no way to know if the setValue is referencing the diffuse_co_ specular_co_ emmissive_co_ etc since it resests to the top of the drop-down.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\ttl_sm_dr\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tpropertyPath of set value action doesn_t_t leave the material.X parameters stickied between edit sessions.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Luaacro","Date":"2016-12-21T09:24:18Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tGood catch !!
