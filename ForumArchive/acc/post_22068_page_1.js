I don_t_t recall where we ended up_co_ and if/how BJS continued support of the Oculus camera_co_ but I quickly need to build a reasonably simple VFX project for multiple mobile devices (including Sony and other Android tablets_co_ as well as IOS and Ipad) and to also identify the Samsung S6 and switch to a stereoscopic camera which supports the Oculus stereoscopic format. I_t_m also fine with building two different scenes - one for most mobile devices_co_ and a seperate scene for the support of the Galaxy S6 paired with the Gear VR. Can anyone provide a code example which renders and displays stereo video on the S6 attached to the Gear VR_sm_ as well as what properties are available in the camera to deliver the best stereo imagery to the Gear VR? I know in our post discussions we covered all of the essential settings for a generic stereo camera such as covergence_co_ divergence_co_ parallax_co_ interaxial seperation_co_ etc._co_ but don_t_t recall defining any settings specific to the Oculus camera and the necessary rendering settings in support of their stereo format. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf anyone has a sample scene and/or the camera code which has been tested and working with the Gear VR_co_ this would assist me a great deal - as I won_t_t need to spend the time once again discovering what works best for the Oculus (Gear VR) stereo display - and can focus all of my time on the scene - as I have a tight schedule to produce a series of stereo effects and controls as a proof of concept to show that babylon.js is capable of rendering everything the client has spec-ed out for the test_co_ and to demonstrate that babylon.js is the best choice for the framework to support both 2D and stereo cameras for future projects - and specifically Oculus at this time since they are currently working directly with Samsung.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ any assistance with supporting the Samsung Gear VR bluetooth controller would be highly appriciated_co_ as this is the other additional spec which I must deliver in a scene which works for most any mobile device (no problem there) and the Oculus camera for the Gear VR and controller. I hve no previous experience using the Ger VR controller_co_ and won_t_t receive the S6_co_ Ger VR_co_ and controller until Thursday - and have a presentation scheduled for this Monday - not my call_co_ but I don_t_t see where there should be any problems other than my inexperience with actually rendering to the Gear VR and using their bluetooth controller.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs always_co_ thanks for any help and/or examples you might provide.

My good fortune came from my _qt_expertise_qt_ in developing some of the first real-time motion capture systems (as I don_t_t want to sound or appear to place myself as an expert in my own mind_co_ but only say this from how others have referred to me in publications from the past). And this forre_t_ into real-time mocap directly provided work with AR_co_ VR_co_ and haptics at a time when these technologies were in their infancy - to the point where I was often criticized for my strong belief that motion capture would become standard practice in entertainment as well as many other industries. But the intense laughter which I experienced from lectures long ago began to change tone as the audiences grew as well.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThere are many factors which cause those individuals who are prone to nasuea to experience equilibrium illness when using current VR/AR technologies. Current AR devices are found to lessen negative reactions from such individuals_co_ however_co_ it is the physical construct of the current devices which cause nasuea_co_ and not anything specific to the VR genre - generally speaking. This is because we are literally _qt_tricking_qt_ our brains into believing that we are immersed in a 3 dimensional world by using _qt_tricks_qt_ to convince our brains that we are in 3 dimensional spaces utilizing mostly 2 dimensional elements.Thus there is a great amount of sensory data missing when using the current 2D VR and AR devices. Although our brains are quite good at interpolating 2 dimensional stereoscopic imagery somewhat mimicking the light which our eyes project onto the back of our retinas_co_ this causes our brains to attempt and make the very best sense of what appears to be placement and actions within 3 dimensional space.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHowever_co_ as this is a very un-natural process only to somewhat mimick 3 dimensional space by using 2D displays to trick our brains_co_ the lack of additional information from an object and its light sources_co_ as well as many other factors such as the process by our brains which construct a representation of our periphery and the speed in which this is processed_co_ attributes to our feelings of nasea. There is a ton of information online which thoroughly explains all aspects of why current VR technology is a _qt_trick_qt_ on the brain and can be unhealthy for our eyes and brains in many ways - and if you are developing any VR and/or AR applications_co_ familiarizing yourself with the fundamentals of how our eyes and brains process our eyesight to represent our physical world spatially_co_ as well as how our brains process color information_co_ will definately help you build better VR and AR experiences - especially with the limitations of the current devices available today and in the near future.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHowever_co_ everthing changes within the next 5 years_co_ as the next generation of VR/AR devices project the equivilency of natural light almost to a precise representation of light emulating in the real world. If you take the time to search through several other posts I_t_ve written on this forum - in the past 3 years or so_co_ you_t_ll find that I cover far more specifically about such devices and how they differ from what is currently in production for the consumer markets. And_co_ you might possibly understand why a major leader in feature film production whom all of you would know - and I_t_m not here to throw names around_co_ so I won_t_t - but this person told me directly - and I quote (almost precisely) _qt_this new device will change the world in the very same way the invention of radio did._qt_ Which at first_co_ I didn_t_t truly believe him_co_ even though he has always been ahead of the rest of the world in adopting successful technologies_co_ and this person rarely makes such a bold statement. Also_co_ in previously working with Ray Kurzweil (there_co_ now I_t_m throwing a name around - but this one_t_s an important figure) - as a _qt_true_qt_ futurist_co_ he is always making predictions_co_ and most of the time entirely correct_co_ with possible exception of the time required to become reality - but as a very intelligent person_co_ he also agrees with my collegue in feature film. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut as I state in other posts_co_ I_t_m legally not permitted to share how this technology works_co_ however_co_ as one of the very fortunate yet few individuals who have been offered the opportunity to use one of the only two existing prototypes for this _qt_light field_qt_ projection technology_co_ I can say with certainty that this device specifically will change the world as we know it - in a very similar if not more profound way than the invention of radio did.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd so to summize an answer to your question concerning nausea or any illness from using VR devices_co_ this is a very real _qt_reality_qt_ with using current technology and the devices available now and in the near future - including the Microsoft Hololens - only once the newer _qt_light field_qt_ projection technology is released_co_ this will be an underlying and soometimes serious side effect for many users of VR and AR. But once this sea change in display technology arrives_co_ there will be no further physical reasons for any nausea or illness to occur_co_ as your equilibrium and other sensory nerves will be naturally stimulated as well as spatial processing by the brain. And the human brain will not be capable of differentiating between reality and simulation - which opens up a whole new areas for discussion_co_ as I_t_m sure all who read this can imagine.

destroyer of cameras.  When Oculus stuff was being changed over to VR_co_  there were all these new cameras being created.  I re-factored anaglyph and all the VR cameras right into the Camera base class.  I also added the 2 stereo rigs.  This means that every camera can be any type of 3D rig with the possible exception of virtual joy stick.  This is what I would stress to the Magic Leap people_co_ I assume.  There are still a lot of camera classes_co_ but many are just wrappers.  Even more rigs could be added_co_ and all cameras would get them.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- 2nd

thing.  Moving images actually make it more difficult to use Vousk_t_s method of evaluating 3D quality.  The test is done by going into side-by-side mode_co_ and putting a horizontal ruler across (using another window).  Stuff should line up if it good.  In tests I do this seems really close_co_ so think lack of working with other post processes is all that I need to

into areas of babylon.js I_t_ve yet to develop. As for supporting Magic Leap_co_ this will require a camera which has really never been developed before_co_ as the rendering process is completely a reverse process of raytracing. What I_t_m currently attempting to show them is that in my opinion babylon.js is an ideal framework for most every aspect of 3 dimensional scene development_co_ animation_co_ etc. up to the point of rendering - excluding lights which will require completely different calculations from how BJS is currently calculating surface illumination_co_ as the required rendering can be generally described as the reverse of firing rays from a camera plane (I_t_m not saying that BJS is using raytracing)_co_ but in order to support Magic Leap display technology_co_ this will require a process where (in a very simplistic description) rays are fired from each light source and are absorbed and reflected when the rays are gathered from each surface area of a scene object.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd thank you for chaning to the current VR camera_co_ as even though I opted for the Gear VR headset_co_ if I don_t_t plug my S6 into the USB port of the headset_co_ I_t_m not locked into the Oculus format - so I have have options to develop for quality alone_co_ and not for any specific licensed format.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo as Magic Leap will most likely be using the Android OS as well as Qualcomm processors - which is what many Android tablets and phones use currently - and they will require developers to produce loads of content_co_ an open source development framework such as babylon.js is ideal_co_ and this framework is the most flexible and adaptible in my opinion and from personal experience. And just to qualify the above_co_ it is _lt_strong_gt_strictly an assumption_lt_/strong_gt_ of mine that the Android OS powered by Qualcomm processors will be ultimately be the hardware and OS they will be shipping with their devices_co_ as well as providing support of existing Android devices in the initial stages of release of their first AR/VR headset display - as Google and Qualcomm are the largest shareholders of Magic Leap aside from the founder Rony Abovitz and a few members of the board of the company.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd a questin to both of you - are there any issues with the latest version of the babylon-master.js file(s) in developing using the VR camera? Also_co_ when I test the _qt_3D Formats_qt_ rigs test scene by _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt_ on my devices including several OS_t__co_ I find that once I make a choice for the VR camera in the dialog GUI_co_ I can always choose any camera as first choice. However_co_ once a choice is made_co_ then I_t_m only able to coose between _qt_OverUnder_qt__co_ _qt_VR_qt__co_ and _qt_None_qt_ as rig types_co_ with a very rare exception of _qt_Anaglyph_qt_ on occasion - with no pattern I can find as to when this might be selectable. I don_t_t know if this will help_co_ but I had the exact same isue in using the bGUI extension for an interface_co_ and the solution was to create a different camera and camera type for the GUI elements - and this change fixed the problem for me in every case.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne more thing - I_t_ve only received all of the components for displaying VR scenes_co_ which I had my choice of practically all available headsts and hardware. I choose the Samsung Gear VR_co_ Samsung S6 phone_co_ and the Moga Pro Bluetooth controller. I almost bought the Samsung S7 phone_co_ but with considerable research_co_ I found that the S6 WebGL graphic performance was ideal for most any scene_co_ even though the S7 has a considerably faster CPU. Although in benchmark testing_co_ the graphic processing and display performance is not improved in direct relation to the improved processor speed - as most every other component including processing RAM is exactly the same. And today_co_ I used several benchmark applications including the AnTuTu Benchmak app which I generally rely on for mobile device benchmarks_co_ and the S6 performace benchmarks were almost the same as my Sony Xperia tablet_co_ and in several of the 3D and HTML 5 bechmark tests_co_ outperformed my tablet - which is still rated as one of the highest on the market. So I personally highly recommend the devices I chose for VR development at this time_co_ as I spent countless hours researching different configurations_co_ specs_co_ and then sellers to find what I believe works best for VR development in BJS currently. The S6 will clip into the Gear VR headset without having to plugin to the USB port_co_ which forces the phone to run the Oculus app which makes development a whoe lot more difficult for me. And the Moga controller functions perfectly as wel as the native Samsung controller_co_ when set to the _qt_B_qt_ pairing setting. And if you want to use the Oculus app and the items from their online store_co_ then simply plug the phone into the Gear VR USB port. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ make certain if you purchase any Samsung or other smartphone through a service provider_co_ or in my case as I required an unlocked phone_co_ make certain the service provider or online seller is completely reputable. In my searching for the best prices online_co_ I found more fake S6 and S7 phones than real ones - as the market is flooded with S4 phones which fit nicely into S6 and S7 cases. And although there are many good videos online showing how to determine if your phone is a fake or not_co_ I found several sources for phones now that don_t_t fail any of the tests to determine if your phone is real or not - and these changes have only appeared in the last few months. So no matter where you purchase your phone_co_ always use one of the various apps to verify that your phone is not a fake. The AnTuTu Benchmak app will do this for practically any smartphone_co_ as well as the _qt_Genuine Galaxy_qt_ app - and there are others as well_co_ however_co_ there are also apps produced by the fake phone manufacturers_co_ however I can guarantee from experience that the two apps listed above are genuine_co_ as this has been a HUGE problem for almost 2 years now_co_ and millions - yes millions of people worldwide have been burned by these companies all out of China - where the real phones are also made. My new S6 was manufactured in Korea_co_ and I_t_m not aware of any fakes from Korea yet_co_ but I don_t_t trust any smartphone seller these days.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_m not a fn of current VR displays_co_ but this is an area which is exploding right now_co_ and soon to be lots of jobs available for developers with VR experience - as well as a huge initial market with a current void of games and content_co_ so sales will certainly be higher for practically any game released around or after Chrismas this year 2016_co_ so it_t_s well worth the experience of learning all of the differeces you need to consider in developing for VR_co_ even if it_t_s simply to gain the experience if you intend on working as a game developer in the future_sm_ at least in my opinion. And right now_co_ you can purchase all of the equipment I_t_m using for about $400_co_ if you are OK with a used S6. Just be very careful_co_ and purchase through Amazon_co_ as you_t_ll find good prices_co_ and they will refund if it_t_s a fake knock-off phone.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
