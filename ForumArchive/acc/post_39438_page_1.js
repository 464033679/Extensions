When I import the same OBJ in other programs like Unity_co_ it understands the hierarchy and treats single objects comprised of multiple meshes as a single object.

I_t_m still stumped_co_ but it_t_s not a hierarchy thing. I_t_m just getting _qt_extra_qt_ meshes. The raw obj file has 4 sets of data under 2 names_co_ and they look duplicated. The Babylon v2 editor somehow understands it contains only 1 object_co_ but the loader gives back 4 meshes. Other more complex OBJ files I have_co_ have way more meshes than I expect_co_ and I think it_t_s a similar problem. I should probably be ignoring meshes somehow_co_ and I_t_m still investigating the details. Simpler OBJ files are fine - these ones I_t_m trying are saved from Google Poly\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Sebavan","Date":"2018-08-14T22:13:24Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHello and Welcome to the forum !!!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCould you share one of those files with us ? it could help analyzing the issue.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"aWeirdo","Date":"2018-08-14T22:19:49Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/32497-benforreal/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_32497_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/32497-benforreal/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@benforreal_lt_/a_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tYou are correct all meshes loaded can be accessed from a single _t_flat_t_ array in the loader_t_s callback_co__lt_br /_gt_\n\thowever_co_ parent/child relations should still be there.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tExample_co_ If your file has three meshes &amp_sm_ mesh 0 is parent of both mesh 1 &amp_sm_ mesh 2_sm__lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\t// Callback_lt_br /_gt_\n\tvar parent _eq_ newMeshes[0] // parent_lt_br /_gt_\n\tvar childA _eq_ newMeshes[1] // child_lt_br /_gt_\n\tvar childB _eq_ newMeshes[2] // child_lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\t// But_lt_br /_gt_\n\tparent ._children[0] should return childA_lt_br /_gt_\n\tparent ._children[1] should return childB_lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\taswell as the array returned by parent._lt_span style_eq__qt_background-color_dd_#ffffff_sm_color_dd_#353c41_sm_font-size_dd_14px_sm__qt__gt_getChildMeshes_lt_/span_gt_() should contain childA &amp_sm_ childB_lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tIf the parent/child relations isn_t_t there_co_ then there_t_s (mostlikely) something wrong in the obj file.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"benforreal","Date":"2018-08-21T20:18:19Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks much for the reply @aweirdo and @sebavan Sorry for the delay_co_ I_t_m new to the forum and thought I_t_d get notifications for replies (I_t_ll need to look for this).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway - I_t_m realizing that you_t_re correct.
