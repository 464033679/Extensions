So for someone who never graduated college_co_ I_t_ve been very lucky my entire career in working on many of the top feature films_co_ video games_co_ TV shows_co_ and now in a Senior Engineer position where everyone else I work with has at least 4 years of University - and most have spent 8 years in college alone studying Math_co_ engineering_co_ and so many other technical . However_co_ since I have such a diverse job background and experience_co_ I actually fit the role uniquely - and beyond most anyone else who has been applying for similar positions. I love my job here_co_ ad hope it continues past my initial year long contract.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI chose the job and moved to San Diego since we lost our home in the _qt_Thomas_qt_ fire a couple of weeks ago. But my family and pets are all OK_co_ and stuff can always be replaced. So I_t_m just thankful for what I do have_co_ and can easily forget about what I no longer have. It_t_s taking allot less time to forget about what we lost than I ever expected. I just had to go to the outlet mall to buy some new clothes_co_ and living out of a hotel sucks - but the alternatives are far worse. My Wife is in Thailand looking after her Mother who is terminally ill and getting worse - so our thoughts are with her in praying she gets better soon and can stay with us a whle longer.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo that_t_s the latest updates from here in California. I love this job_co_ and I hope everyone reading this stays working in WebGL_co_ and specifically in babylon.js. The job opportunities are simply exploding out there right now_co_ and in particular babylon.js as it_t_s far more organized than three.js_co_ as it was an easy task to convince Sony to invest in babylon.js over three.js simply because it_t_s far more organized_co_ and has much more support comparatively. So stick with it_co_ and I_t_m sure most all of you will also begin to get calls from recruiters daily begging for you to come work wherever you wish.And the salaries are beginning at $100_co_000 US and I have to say I_t_m paid far greater than this in my job capacity here at Sony.
