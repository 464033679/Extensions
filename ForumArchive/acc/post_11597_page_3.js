So_co_ technically_co_ the algorithm can_t_t find triangles to delete._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I am working on improving that. The original method that was used is very fast and works great_co_ but shows to be not working correctly with certain meshes. The main problem is really how those meshes are built and the lack of real-time border-detection (that is sadly not so possible)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Can you send me the dinosaur?
