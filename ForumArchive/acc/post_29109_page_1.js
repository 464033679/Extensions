Basically every time a projectile is shot_co_ I_t_m putting up a ParticleSystem for a splash effect. This works maybe 10 times_co_ but then no sprites at all is created. The function is the same_co_ I have even tried recycling the Particle System with stop/start so no more than 8 are created. I tried to use clone_co_ but it complains that the texture is undefined.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI looked into the custom function and it seems the recycle function stops running.
