I need to try with no overlapping visible meshes_co_ but I still need an overlapping invisible plane to detect the click.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2 Merging / Instancing doubts._lt_br /_gt_\n\tMerging a big group of boxes has really amazing FPS performance (even on mobile with a large world)_co_ but freezes the browser.
