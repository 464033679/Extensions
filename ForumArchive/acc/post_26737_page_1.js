You mostly be digging a lot in this forum and there quite people are one or two can help. As well what you depend on the skill and experience in javascript. Basically you have create your own custom build engine or some simple stuff since you need to learn more than just wanted to build the game. It does math coding and handling error that seem to not try catch. There is not in depth deep code or how to setup the right way it all depend on skill and looking for right setup.

In your question you talk about a parent object and a child object but then you talk about moving the object and it is then not clear to me which object you are talking about. I know that sometimes people have problems moving a parent without moving a child so have given a way of doing this using a function I made in the playground that follows called translateOnlyMe which when applied to a mesh with children does just that - only moves the parent.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n\t_lt_/p_gt_\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1S4VM3_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1S4VM3_lt_/a_gt_\n\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMore information about positions_co_ rotations_co_ translate and rotate can be found by starting here _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//babylonjsguide.github.io/basics/Position_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//babylonjsguide.github.io/basics/Position_lt_/a_gt_ and then following the further reading.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhat I do suggest to get the best possible help available in the forum would be to start a new topic when the question does not relate directly to an existing topic title.

So perhaps using a framework which is more tailored in its_t_ design and tools developed more specifically for a 2D game_co_ if you are able to use babylon.js and gain the experience_co_ then it_t_s quite easy these days to supliment your income to provide you with the resources and tools necessary to carry you through the time required to develop a real product you can release for profit - if this is your goal. Otherwise_co_ you may likely spend your time stressing out during the development process - which most developers rarel make it through and rarely deliver te game or application they set out to build. Perhaps your situation is different and tese are not concerns_co_ but gaining the experience I now have using babylon.js allows me to take on well paying work when I need to cover costs and certainly living expeses.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut of course_co_ it_t_s a matter of first designing your game with babylon.js in mind_co_ and putting together simple scenes as proof of concept that BJS will provide you whatever the needs of your game are. This would be my recommendation_co_ asI get called for jobs in WebGL weekly beginning about 6 months ago - and am able to supliment my income greatly while still focusing on my company_t_s own application which we will finally bring to market in Jan. of 2017. I began using BJS about 3 years ago now_co_ and although I knew this would become a valued skillset_co_ I still find it difficult to believe how many jobs are now coming to bear - as every single company and/or recruiter tells me clearly that they cannot find anyone with WebGL experience - so I find myself practically able to name my own price when it comes to accepting work - not all the time_co_ but more than often.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo as many devs on this forum recommend  - as I do also - that a 2D framework would perhaps be an easier framework for you to develop you 2D game_co_ this will not provide you with the additional experience required to seek other work within WebGL (in my own opinion)_co_ whereas babylon.js experience is a huge commodity and growing amost exponentially today. So I guess it all depends upon your personal goals and where you want to be in  2 - 3 years. As for me_co_ I finally find my work within WebGL  engaging and interesting one again - after being bored to death repeting the same work again and again creating films and games on the standard platforms - whereas within WebGL I_t_m once again creating things for the very first time in history_co_ and always a challenge - which for me_co_ keeps me alive and excited to begin work each day.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t consider the above comments off topic_co_ however I_t_m guessing this is a different approach to answering your question. But for me_co_ I try to look towards the future_co_ and can clearly see that babylon.js offers me possibilities to discover new challenges_co_ opportunities_co_ and technologies - and to both create - and to find a far more interesting future than what I might consider as the easiest path to accomplish the singular goal directly in front of me at this time.
