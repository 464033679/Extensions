I have always had mixed results using this format in any project_co_ as there is limited support and many issues when trying to conform this format outputting from 3rd party applications such as blender. Either .OBJ_co_ .FBX_co_ and others are far more reliable to either directly import into a WebGL framework_co_ or as in FBX to move scenes from application to application. If you simply discard using the gtlf format in exchange for something else more mainstream_co_ you_t_ll find a pipeline which works well for your needs. If the need is to import directly into a WebGL framework_co_ then OBJ is a good way to go - then you can build your materials and textures run time JavaScript. Otherwise_co_ if using babylon.js_co_ then the .babylon format is ideal in so many ways. Just a little experimentation to become familiar with a reliable pipeline will make life so much easier for you.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd I would avoid ANY WebGL framework which you have to pay for. This isn_t_t because of the price_co_ but because you_t_re completely relying on a company and it_t_s limited resources which you are investing your time and future in. And their growth and maininence is completely dependant on developers such as you - which are extremely limited. Whereas open source frameworks are driven by communities of users - which now have grown far beyond what any for profit company can possibly compete with. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs a former Senior Software Engineer for Sony Electronics_co_ we could afford any API to create products using WebGL_co_ and we chose babylon.js as it is a very cohesive framework and more reliable than practically any open source framework we_t_ve ever used. Remember WebGL is a standard for browser rendering_co_ and not a product for revenue driven by a company which needs you. Yet this community (BJS) is far better than any for profit _qt_API_qt_ I_t_ve yet to use. This is for many reasons which I won_t_t go into now. But if you wish to continue to develop for WebGL as a future for yourself_co_ I guarantee that babylon.js will survive well beyond the demise of companies such as the Russian company Triumph who produced blend4web. And BJS far out functions their API now and forever. There is no future competing with the existing opensource frameworks for WebGL. Not my opinion_co_ but simple economics.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnd back to your original issue_co_ again - a few hours working with formats other than the out-dated gtlf format (even the Khronos Group doesn_t_t use or support this format any longer) is a few hours spent in your future. I_t_ve been down this road personally_co_ which is why I_t_m so passionate about trying to direct newbies in the right direction - for their own future.

This allows far more flexibility when using OBJ files dynamically and/or at run time. I_t_ll be experimenting with gtLF files on a project this weekend - and hopefully_co_ find them useful.
