(FYI_dd_ i went up to 200k instances).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe key points to look at is how I moved all the members with _qt_immutable_qt_ types (numbers_co_ booleans_co_ strings) in Node and AbstractMesh to the .prototypes_co_ so that they don_t_t have to be repeated in each instance unless they are changed. This is IMHO one key interesting properties of javascript. This cannot be done safely for mutable types_co_ so I added a _qt_lite_qt_ parameter that I turned on just for instanced meshes to reduce memory there.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt is possible there is a good reason why things were not done this way_co_ hence why i_t_m opening a discussion here.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_m not suggesting this specific implementation for production_co_ as it is pretty much just hacked together at the moment. But I do believe that the general philosophy of only paying for the features you use is a good one. It would be better if the responsibilities of the objects was more composable_sm_ We could make greater use of interfaces and mixins_co_ for things like collisions_co_ for example. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThen of course there is the matter of increasing the performance in general of the mesh collection phase_co_ as well as setting of the position vertex attributes. For my application_co_ the existing method of checking visibility at every frame is not workable. I_t_ll also require some more fundamental batch/buffer generation and maintenance that lasts over multiple frames_co_ instead of this method of generating the position buffers every frame like is done here.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLet me propose that I think that all visibility culling and buffer generation results should last across frames_co_ since in most applications these will be similar from one frame to the next. It_t_s an easy argument to make for buffer generation_co_ but a harder one for visibility culling.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThoughts?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_02/Ref.png.ee5c023df09d67f96834d2d5c18ced36.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_11687_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_02/Ref.thumb.png.7333e35ffb605f168062565eb2c2d369.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_Ref.png_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n_lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_02/After.png.e18dbc72ebcae88c5cd4e080ba76034e.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt__gt__lt_img data-fileid_eq__qt_11688_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2017_02/After.thumb.png.fb1e8d1b274d5f3ca69b595901d84fe9.png_qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ alt_eq__qt_After.png_qt__gt__lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-02-20T17:49:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHello!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tthis is really interesting_dd_) You save a lot of memory by sharing properties and this is clever but this is something we can_t_t do at framework level. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe foundation of babylon.js is simplicity.
