Also in my actual scene it doesn_t_t seem to be working at all_co_ but it_t_s hard to tell if it_t_s related to the issue I am having w conversion_co_ since I need to rotate the sphere to get it to show up to begin with. Shader is here_dd_ (it appears blank at first_co_ but if you rotate it youll start to see the fire. The actual effect I am going for you will see only if you rotate it just right so that you see the fire starting with the white in the middle_co_ and it filling up the sphere).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//cyos.babylonjs.com/#M11GKA_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//cyos.babylonjs.com/#M11GKA_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe source shader is here_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3RH_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3RH_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo the one place I was not sure how to proceed_co_ was mapping over the iResolution variable (which shadertoy states is the viewport resolution).
