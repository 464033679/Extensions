How could other WebGL canvases used with BabylonJS? Is it possible? In the following some background wondering._lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tHere is one titled _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//xn--https-rfa//blog.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js-ar-js-a-frame-vr-mapbox-ar-vr-93c09be08742_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Mapbox GL JS + AR.js + A-Frame (VR) _eq_ Mapbox AR/VR_lt_/a_gt_¬†and at¬†_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//blog.mapbox.com/launching-custom-layers-with-uber-2a235841a125_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//blog.mapbox.com/launching-custom-layers-with-uber-2a235841a125_lt_/a_gt_¬†is an example of Three.js being used to import a glft model into a scene (_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//bl.ocks.org/ryanbaumann/b9725e79b5b1742d92ada00ddbf5c3d3_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_this_lt_/a_gt_) and more on integrating MapBox and deck.gl at¬†_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//medium.com/vis-gl/deckgl-and-mapbox-better-together-47b29d6d4fb1_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//medium.com/vis-gl/deckgl-and-mapbox-better-together-47b29d6d4fb1_lt_/a_gt_¬†and a note on camera things too._lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tTo my brains this feels like really cool way to visualize geographic data sets and even cooler would be to add virtual reality things here. I could assume that since MapBox and deck.gl work together and render into a WebGL canvas and the first link demonstrates capturing the buffer as an image and project it to AR.js cube_co_ something like that could be done with BabylonJS too. Maybe avoid the capturing the WebGL buffer as a image altogether. The second link also shows how ThreeJS gltf model was imported into map data._lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tI can somewhat follow the examples how MapBox and deck.gl are used together_co_ but I have very little clue how could I bring BabylonJS in the future to make the stuff even sweeter! That is_co_ I_t_m thinking to start with data visualization with MapBox and deck.gl as far as the examples go_co_ but sooner or later move towards BabylonJS. I_t_m not sure how possible is it to use BabyloJS (hopeful due to AR.js example) or what should I know APIwise or otherwise with this endeavour. _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_P_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_tongue.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_P_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\tSome help or nudge or whatnot on offer? _lt_span_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/span_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_br /_gt_\n\t¬†\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ssaket","Date":"2018-10-26T04:33:35Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSure !
