 I will begin testing with some of these functions DK exposed as well as some of the cases to see where I_t_m able to integrare our node.js server to stream a video as a texture on a 3D object to multi-users to use my real-time muilti-user drawing application to paint directly onto an object with a streaming video as a texture - on a paused video frame which is captured and then applied to a mesh is fine for our needs.  This I have yet to figure out_co_ so I really bow down to the big brains on this forum to open up their Mensa minds for the immense task to paint on streaming video  - paused or not.  Even if I must capture a single frame from the video and map on a single plane to apply as a MultiMaterial along with a dynamic texture to be able to paint on the streaming or on a single captured frame of video.  Those of you who know what I_t_m asking understands that his is certainly a challenge.  I_t_m very concerned the Babylon.js framework may not be currently capable of accomplishing this_co_ but I certainly hope that if not now_co_ then soon - as once I have this in place_co_ it is a custom app as a favor I_t_m writing for Peter Jackson and Richard Taylor who own Weta - and they will be happy to send a personal  letter(I_t_m speaking for them as friends) to ANYONE who finds a solution to this challenge.  I will also invirte you to tour Weta film Studios and Weta Workshop with Sir Richard Taylor and Sir Peter Jackson_co_ as they will extend their gratitude to any of the Mensa brains who might find the solution to this before I do_sm_ and I_t_m not a Mensa member (never applied_co_ as I don_t_t do well with rejection._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So if anyone is able to find the solution for this_co_ and you are able to book a ticket to NZ_co_ I will ensure that you receive a tour from Peter Jackson personally on his Stone Street Studios_co_ as well as the fantastic tour of Weta Workshop from Richard Taylor - which will absolutly change your outlook for what is really doable in current feature film and other production - as these places rival NASA - really - and you_t_ll find feature film history that any you will absolutely appriciate - and everyone you know will be amazed by your stories for years to come._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So I_t_ve promised allot here_co_ which is most likely not necessary_co_ however I_t_m under a deadline_co_ and will ask my good friends who own Weta to help with the incentive to accomplish the key function of this app which we want to begin beta testing in 30 days - with additional featires_co_ of course.  I_t_ll post the entire real-time Multi-user app on the forum once it_t_s ready for Beta.  Users such as Temechon have a link to an alpha now of our real-time multiuser creative drawing app_co_ but we_t_ll see if he believes this app is as impressive as I am eluding to.  It_t_s certainly fun to use_co_ but Pete is counting the days until it is ready for use in his next production.  I can explain why at a later date_co_ if it_t_s not already obvious - but this type of knowledge would only be understood from working in feature film dailies._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Oh_co_ and I_t_ll try and be there too_co_ to make sure that all of the _qt_juicy_qt_ stories and pictures are told and shown to make your tours a VERY special event for whomever might get there._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And as always_co_ I appriciate any help from anyone who might assist in providing a solution to help me get to the end goal of painting directly on sreaming video in real-time._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DB_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2015-09-11T15:34:21Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Wow.  Thanks for that_co_ DB!  That sounds great! _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Ok_co_ just a quick opinion_co_ here.  You are dealing with an area that is NOT part of BJS... and that_t_s getting a frame of video... into a context2D object.  Once you have that... your interaction with BJS... comes alive.  And what you are talking here... is continuously _qt_broadcasting_qt_ AND _qt_receiving_qt_... a _qt_live_qt_ context2D image buffer.

regarless of some odd requests from time to time.  And since I left Weta_co_ they have remained good friends as opposed to other directors which will go un-named.  And I only mention this as important to me - since each of us together as a core team bleed out our hearts and souls in order to make challenging films such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and others.  Things never seen or done before - so you become quite good friends over years of working long hours 7 days a week - and Richard and Pete blled more than anyone in making their films.  So it_t_s an honor to remain good friends after going through so much together._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Anyway_co_ I thought I_t_d mention this as I didn_t_t want anyone to think I might be making moneyfrom this with a company who can certainly afford to pay well for this.

which is by far one of the greatest places on earth.  It_t_s much better than a trip to Disneyland_co_ as Disneyland is the only experience which I can think of that might be comparable in any way - but Workshop is far better.  I can perhaps get Pete to commit to giving a tour of Stone Street Studios_co_ but I_t_m only cautious_co_ as Pete_t_s time is incredibly difficult to get - as he works harder than ANYONE in film and entertainment (perhaps only Richard_t_s time commitment and level of work can compare to Pete_t_s work commitment_co_) and although they both have families_co_ they both have to be a Father everyday as they aren_t_t hollywood types with nannies and servants.  They both care for their children as any normal parent_co_ drive them to school_co_ do the cooking_co_ cleaning_co_ laundry_co_ etc._co_ and don_t_t provide any bit of what you would think someone worth almost a billion dollars would live as a lifestyle.  And Richard is my best friend_co_ so he would make a tour I request a priority_co_ where Pete would choose time with his kids first.  And Richard does also_co_ but he always finds time for my rediculous requests._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So if you fit the profile of anyone mentioned above_co_ and get to Wellington (let me know in advance to make certain they are at home and not shooting abroad_co_) you are welcome to a personal tour by Sir Richard Taylor_co_ and Peter Jackson - if I can lock him down in Wellington for a few hours.  But for anyone to provide me with a working example of painting on a streaming video_co_ I_t_ll do my best to make certain that you receive tours from both Richard and Pete.  Although_co_ your tour of Workshop will be the one which will live in your memory as one of the best days ever.  And you can also get some _qt_real dirt_qt_ on me from Richard if you ask him - that is_co_ if any of my dirty secrets have value to anyone.  But Richard and I have been to hell and back_co_ so you_t_d hear allot anyway._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_And Wingnut_co_ thanks for your _qt_analysis_qt_ of some of the elements and operations required to make this all come together.  The good news is that I already have all of the functions and elements you mention working now - and with Temechon_t_s assistance with the use of bGUI_co_ I have a very nice real-time multi-user app and interface which allows many users to simultaniously draw on any 3D object in their own color_co_ brush size_co_ and all of these attributes unique to each user are drawn on every participating local user_t_s screen in real time_co_ maintaining all unique attibutes when drawn - so it_t_s working now and is allot of fun to use.  I sent Temechon the first alpha version of this for him to see and to test_co_ and haven_t_t checked my email yet today to get his feedback.  But once I finish version1 of the app (no video drawing on version1)_co_ I_t_ll post it on this forum for everyone to use and to provide feedback if they would be so kind._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I still have much to do to solve the painting on streaming video_co_ but I_t_m so very close.  I expect Version 1 will be finished this weekend (finally0_co_ and version 2 should follow within a week later - I hope.  Again_co_ thanks for reading through my exhaustive posts (I_t_m guessing some of you can tell that I_t_ve written a couple of novels previously.)  Please keep any ideas coming_co_ and I look forward to calling the guys at Weta to schedule a tour - whether it_t_s for a user who provides me with a working example of all that I need (which I pretty much have everything I need already_co_ and will be posting soon_co_) or most likely_co_ all of you mavericks who are spending countless hours writing this framework which allows us to have an open source framework to produce work within -
