Glad to hear your take on this. I completely agree that the playground is a valuable source to learn and try out bits of code_co_ but I think documenting the api_t_s would still be beneficial for reference (parameter descriptions_co_ option descriptions_co_ optimal use cases).  Also searching through the forum is time consuming work to find the example that applies to your use case. As far as examples_co_ I think a playground link on the api page is the way to go as it would be easy to find and give users the ability to expand on the code. This code should be line by line commented to explain exactly what is going on which is something I rarely find in the examples.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2018-03-19T23:54:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ve been talking about this for a long time that the class documentation should have some small examples of using the functions and maybe some properties.

As far as I understand it the API class documentation is generated from the Babylon typescript files directly. This makes sense as then any updates to any classes would result in changes in the API. The first problem is that this works well when the typescript file has appropriate comments but many older files need these comments added and help is needed there. Somebody_co_ outside the core team_co_  was working on improving the _t_build_t_ engine that generated the API documentation however like all open source programs work and life get in the way and projects get dropped_co_ or paused for a long time_co_ without being finished. Nobody is at fault it is just the nature of open source. There is a _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/mootari/Documentation/tree/rewrite-generator-assemble_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_github_lt_/a_gt_ where this was started so anyone with the skill and inclination could communicate with the author and Deltakosh to help continue the work. Secondly to incorporate PGs into the API the _t_build_t_ engine would need additional code and somebody would need not only to write that code but people would be needed to write or find appropriate PGs to link to. Anyone is welcome to volunteer for this.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-03-20T19:58:56Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI asked _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_10310_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/10310-raananw/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@RaananW_lt_/a_gt_ to work on the API documentation generation tool and he kindly accepted\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe will soon have a better API documnetation\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf anyone wants to help_co_ please just add typedoc comments to any uncommented function\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe are also enforcing any new PR to come with commented code\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
