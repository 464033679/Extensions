I don_t_t know exactly when this started. But last I added some HTML UI with jquery.. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So model loads fine. And when move the camera (change position) _co_ framerate immediately gets reduced to 5-6 fps (Including potential). Then If I stop the camera for 5-10 second it again comes back to 60 fps steady (potential 200-300). Or even if I just change the camera rotation _co_ it stays stead at 60fps. Only when I move the camera_co_ it gets reduced drastically. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is true even for a camera view which has just couple hundreds active vertices and 3-4 draw calls. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Since this is related to camera move_co_ Is the collision creating problem?  I have enabled collision for all objects._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2015-06-16T15:46:40Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_This sounds like a collision related issue. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_How complex are the meshes in the proximity of the camera?

If the fps reduction is due to collisions_co_ this might keep your fps high.
