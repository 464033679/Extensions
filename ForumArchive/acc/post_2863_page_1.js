The labyrinth is generated and made out of planes (walls). The idea was to throw the FPS camera to the maze and let the player character find a way out. The problem I have is the camera collision detection_co_ probably. Most of the time when my poor badly lost character walks and hits the wall_co_ it gets kind of stuck and then slowly pulled into the other side of the wall. The collision detection works sometimes though._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Are there any tips for making the camera collision better or idea what causes this behavior?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_FYI The maze_t_s walls are made of planes_co_ all walls have a size of 1. At first it_t_s kind of a grid and then I tear down the walls with an algorithm to make the cells available the player to move into. After generating a complete labyrinth I_t_m left with lots of planes where two planes are exactly in the same position. This is intentional. So other cell_t_s wall (plane) against the another cell_t_s wall. Just wondering - would this two meshes sharing the same position somehow confuse the collision detection?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_-Karpo_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2014-01-02T09:33:47Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_It should work.
