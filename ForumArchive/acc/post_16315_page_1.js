I have been a programmer for about 8 years and been trying to get into the indie game industry for right at 1 year. I started with Phaser and love/loved it but needed something else for 3d development._lt_br_gt_I started Aletheia Game Studios where I teach kids how to make video games. I_t_ve found that even though I just basically started myself teaching people drives me to learn faster._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//aletheiagamestudio.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//aletheiagamestudio.com/_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_m building a modular game engine on top of babylonjs call A3D. It is designed for my students (ages 8-16) for them to be able to make a scene in blender and then export it_co_ and then only have to modify a small configuration file and have a game ready based on the chosen game type (scroller_co_ adventure_co_ platformer_co_ fps etc). I did have to modify the exporter a little bit but otherwise I keep babylonjs vanilla. My engine just wraps around it sorta... and it is very_co_ very much in it_t_s infancy_co_ and I am hesitant to share he github with it being so young but here it is. (Poorly commented and no documentation and ultra buggy so please don_t_t try to use it unless you are just a glutton for punishment) _dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/aletheiagamestudio/A3D_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/aletheiagamestudio/A3D_lt_/a_gt__lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_and the modules_dd__lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/aletheiagamestudio/A3D-Modules/tree/master/Platformer_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/aletheiagamestudio/A3D-Modules/tree/master/Platformer_lt_/a_gt__lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_I_t_m basically building as I_t_m teaching. _lt_br_gt__lt_br_gt_I_t_m also entering gamedev.net_t_s game competition next week with 2 of my older students (15 and 16).
