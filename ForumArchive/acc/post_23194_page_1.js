And many devlopers including myself have been down this hole many times in the past. Unfortunately_co_ it_t_s like a game of ping-pong_co_ where the state of the ball (in this case_co_ browsers) is always in play and constantly moving from side to side. This means that as soon as I find one issue with one browser_co_ it is often fixed the same or the next day - especially if someone files a bug report.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ I and others have tried to get a handle on specific browser support_co_ but have found this is not possible as there are so many factors involved - especially in memory management. For me_co_ I generally recommend Chrome simply because of the resources behind it_t_s development_co_ as well as it_t_s greater compatability on average with most media as well as frameworks such as WebGL. So your personal choice is relevant only for some browsers which have legacy issues and limited resources and development personnel. Otherwise_co_ it_t_s generally apples and oranges - with Chrome almost always coming in the top three for performance_co_ and more often #1.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut it is always good to write posts such as this when someone identifies a specific issue which generally provides the info for developers to know that it_t_s not their scene which is necessarily the problem when they find a bug_co_ and this can save hours and even days of work when someone posts these specifics on the forum.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn addition_co_ there is great value when someone recognizes a specific browser which has a compatability others do not - such as using the Samsung browser to render scenes on the GearVR without the need to plug the device into the headset. So again_co_ these posts are valuable_co_ but I hope you can avoid any frustrations as I used to have_co_ as the technical and functional aspects of browsers change daily_co_ and there is very little we can document which won_t_t be completely different in a day or week at most.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe biggest issue I still deal with and monitor is memory management_co_ and specifically GC - however the babylon.js team and contributors are working on optimizations with every release_co_ and contributors such as _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_8492_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JCPalmer_lt_/a_gt_ are constantly optimizing every zero and decimal point to improve every aspect of file handling and memory. So as long as you have the latest version of your preferred browser_co_ you_t_re doing everything you can to maintain top performance.
