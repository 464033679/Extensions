I tried to make a cube with 6 different colored sides. Therefore I added 6 sub meshes with 6 vertices each. I can now color one side if I use the material index_co_ but when I want to switch to the next side it doesn_t_t seem to switch. The next material index is selected but I still the color of the first side on the diffuse panel. If I change that color again I only change one side of the cube. So I can_t_t get to the other 5 sides.
