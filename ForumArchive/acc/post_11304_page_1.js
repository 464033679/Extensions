game is being built_co_ there._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Sometimes the yellow cube just stops... and you need to do a little move in another direction before continuing.  And sometimes I see the stutters happening in the same locations... and repeatable.  I think collisions are causing the stutter.  You might try to monitor for collisions by turning the cube a different color whenever it collides with something.  That way_co_ if the cube changes color when a stutter happens_co_ you know that it was a collision that caused it  (and thus target your troubleshooting in THAT area)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_m going to guess.  (What_t_s new?)  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_

Just for fun_co_ you might want to try _lt_em_gt_cube.ellipsoidOffset _eq_ new BABYLON.Vector3(0_co_ 0.1_co_ 0)_sm_   _lt_/em_gt_... in your game_scene.js .addCube function.  That SHOULD bring the collision ellipsoid off the ground a tiny bit._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Or maybe try this... cube.ellipsoid _eq_ new BABYLON.Vector3(0.5_co_ _lt_u_gt__lt_strong_gt_0.9_lt_/strong_gt__lt_/u_gt__co_ 0.5)_sm_.  I think that will shrink the collision ellipsoid_t_s height just a bit (which will maybe lift the ellipsoid off the ground_co_ depending upon cube height). _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Smarter people than I... will soon be here to help.  I know for a fact that Dad72 is an ellipsoid collision EXPERT!  (He_t_s pretty
