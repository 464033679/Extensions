While it is not a problem to rotate the hands according to the correct time_co_ I am not getting the correct time. It seems like the hands are opposite where they are supposed to be. Exactly opposite. I put together a playground demo to show what I am doing. Has anyone had experience with this?

At say 3_dd_30 the hour hand should be mid way between the 3 and the 4. This is not happening for some reason.  Thank you for getting me on the right track though.
