I assumed that if I launch a new Chrome browser_co_ that Javascript files were refreshed.  However_co_ there is no refreshing of any files that I can find until the refresh button is pressed.  I couldn_t_t properly troubleshoot this as the timing problems wouldn_t_t expose a changed file even on refresh for up to 10+ seconds.  So_co_ even though the files were correct upon refresh_co_ the browser loaded from cache as the server didn_t_t respond in a timely fashion._lt_/em_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_em_gt_The only way I discovered this was to start from a sample scene online.  I used the loadScene.html file from paddyschller.com_co_ and copied ALL of the files from the working directory into a new directory on our server.  When I found this basic scene loaded correctly (mostly)_co_ I then renamed the babylon.js file so that it could not be loaded.  I then refreshed the page and of course the scene wouldn_t_t load at all.  Then I renamed the babylon.js file correctly on the server_co_ and the scene still would not load with a new Chrome browser and typing the full path to the html file.  I refreshed the browser and found the file still wouldn_t_t load - so I retried (refresh button) until it loaded.  I have the exact same results when using links with no browser open_co_ and realized that the only way to refresh any files was to press the refresh button._lt_/em_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_em_gt_I assume there is a setting in the advanced options in Chrome to change this_co_ but I haven_t_t looked yet.  For developing quickly_co_ I hope an automatic refresh can be set.  _lt_/em_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Again_co_ I don_t_t know if this is affecting anyone else_co_ however I_t_m guessing were all modifying Javascript files as quickly as possible and copying those to the server for immediate testing.  So I thought it worth posting - although slightly embarrassing for me.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_rolleyes_dd__qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In the posts I read on this forum_co_ many people are receiving a 404 error in their browser_co_ so I assume a potion of these might be due to browser cache refresh.  At the minimum_co_ it forced us to encrypt our login info and rewrite our webconfig file._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_If this helps anyone_co_ please let me know._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_DBawel_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"RaananW","Date":"2014-12-30T09:25:32Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hi DBawel_co__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_there are many ways to avoid this _qt_js not refreshing_qt_ problem.
