The first problem is which plane. Think of your ray as an axis then a plane along the ray can be rotated around the ray at any angle.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tA ray has an origin and a direction (and possibly a length)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne way to place the plane along the line is to choose a line within the plane and then align this with the ray line. as in this PG _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#23HHWK%233_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#23HHWK#3_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNote however that this depends on writing the vectors in the cross product in the right order.
