Even with re-structured documentation newcomers will still do the same thing. With the old set of documentation and the help of everybody in the forum I was able to learn and am still learning with the new documentation and the forum. Now I can go to the new documentation and search for what I need and still when I do not understand come to the forum._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So I suppose the question is given the amount of work needed to restructure the documentation what would be the benefit to newcomers_co_ existing users_co_ the forum and the authors and other experts and extending the use of BJS. In other words does the cost justify the benefits._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2015-10-11T11:58:04Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_ _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_  I was only looking for comments on the changes I proposed.  But yeah_co_ these are all good points.  Some of the things you mentioned... are covered by the Babylon Primer._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Yep_co_ yep_co_ yep...

John.  hmm.  I don_t_t think we have the _qt_system_qt_ in-place that could do that_co_ yet_co_ but it_t_s certainly worth pondering.  The HTML for our docs/tuts... is pre-generated from .md files_co_
