I have implemented the drag drop system from the playground (_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com_lt_/a_gt_) and it works for objects which have been placed on the scene.  _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_My issue is is that I now want to click a button to BUY an object (mesh) and as soon as I mouse up from the button the mesh would follow my mouse (like the drag and drop) and stop after I click again to place the object. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I have tried to expand the drag drop to allow this but in its current implementation it has to have a click/pick event on the mesh I want to move. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Has any one expanded the drag drop to work with and without a click event or do I have to make a second set of functions to do this? _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Cheers for any help you can pass my way. _lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jessepmason","Date":"2015-12-12T09:45:50Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_I think you are correct!_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is how I have been doing it..._lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#27ERB0%231_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#27ERB0#1_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_instructions_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_- click the -editor button to close the editor panel (it wont work otherwise)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_- click on the red plane (pretend this is your css buy button)_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_- sphere should be moving with the mouse_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_- click again somwhere on a mesh and the sphere should stop moving_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_if someone knows a more efficient way_co_ let me know! _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_tongue.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_P_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jamessimo","Date":"2015-12-15T00:34:29Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_108938_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_19207_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_jessepmason_qt_ data-cite_eq__qt_jessepmason_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1449913550_qt__gt__lt_div_gt__lt_div_gt__lt_p_gt_I think you are correct!_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is how I have been doing it..._lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#27ERB0%231_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#27ERB0#1_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/blockquote_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So looking at your code I see that you have a global _lt_em_gt_buy _lt_/em_gt_bool that gets set if you click the buy button_co_ then it simply maps the _lt_em_gt_buyMesh_lt_/em_gt__t_s X Y to your on mouse move X Y._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is fine inside a Babylon scene_lt_strong_gt_ but would this not work_lt_/strong_gt_ if your buy button was made with_lt_strong_gt_ HTML&amp_sm_ CSS_lt_/strong_gt_ and lived outside the BABYLON Scene._lt_/p_gt__lt_pre class_eq__qt_ipsCode prettyprint_qt__gt_var onPointerUp _eq_ function(evt) { /* THIS WOULD NEVER GET CALLED IF THE BUTTON WAS HTML */  pickResult _eq_ scene.pick(evt.clientX_co_ evt.clientY)_sm_  if (buy) {    //....  } else {    if (pickResult.hit) { /* THIS WOULD NEVER GET CALLED IF THE BUTTON WAS HTML */      //....      pickedMesh _eq_ pickResult.pickedMesh_sm_      if (pickedMesh.name _eq__eq_ _qt_buyButton_qt_) { /* THIS WOULD NEVER GET CALLED IF THE BUTTON WAS HTML */        //Place the mesh over the mouse and set BUY to TRUE      }    }  }}_lt_/pre_gt__lt_p_gt_So this solution is not ideal as most html5 game UI is made with either Markup or a canvas object_co_ this implementation requires the BABYLON mouse event to be fired over a mesh (to extract the mouse coords from the event)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Would it be better to ignore the _lt_em_gt_onPointerUp _lt_/em_gt_function and some how after I click my HTML button to first create the bought object_co_ then some how force the _lt_em_gt_ scene.pick(evt.clientX_co_ evt.clientY)_sm_ _lt_/em_gt_On the newly created object? _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Is this possible?
