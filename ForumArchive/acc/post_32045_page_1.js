Been stuck at around 40fps consistently.

Now I_t_m not so sure_co_ because after reducing my draw calls from a minimum 350 when I load my scene_co_ to 200_co_ I haven_t_t really seen a FPS boost.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBefore I continue to refactor to reduce the number of draw calls_co_ I figured I would ask_co_ am I missing something here? Or is that still a large number of draw calls_co_ which could be causing or contributing to the low FPS?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"aWeirdo","Date":"2017-07-30T23:33:06Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/24959-thrice/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_24959_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/24959-thrice/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@thrice_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDrawcalls have a big impact_co_ especially if you_t_re also targeting mobile / tablet / low-end laptops etc\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTexture wise_co_ it would be optimal to only have one_co_ e.g a spritesheet/texture atlas to really knock away some drawcalls.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tGeometry wise_co_ using fewer and simpler models and instancing &gt_sm_(or) cloning where possible.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Convergence","Date":"2017-07-31T03:22:49Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tEach material per mesh(or instance thereof) is basically one draw call. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSeconding @aWeirdo_co_ having all cards of the same suit in one large texture would likely reduce draw calls by a lot.
