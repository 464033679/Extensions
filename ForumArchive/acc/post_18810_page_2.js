So I obviously need to catch up. The only rendering process I_t_ve been working with lately is Light Field Rendering (LFR)_co_ or attempting to emulate or build an efficient optimized model/process to emulate LFR. LFR is the way that natural light is reflected and/or absorbed on physical objects in the real world_co_ and why Magic Leap displays are completely natural and realistic to the human eye - far beyond any 2D or 3D simulated renderer. No one has ever seen anything like this_co_ unless you_t_ve actually used the Magic Leap prototypes - which there are only two currently - one at Magic Leap_t_s home office in Florida_co_ and one at Weta in NZ._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I can_t_t say much else at this time_co_ however_co_ those of you who know me on this forum_co_ know that I_t_ve been saying I believe this technology will truly and dramatically change the world as we know it_co_ and far more than any other invention in the last few decades. So if you want to better understand the future of rendering and displays_co_ study Light Field Rendering. As for now_co_ what DK_co_ David_co_ and others (I_t_m not certain who else contributed)_co_ what they have currently developed as the PBR renderer looks fantastic! And I_t_m really looking forward to personally understanding the renderer better and the functions we might add in the future to achieve even more realism in the BJS rendering engine. For anyone who is reading this_co_ you are definately in the right place and working with the framework and standards of the future_sm_ the near future - which is really taking off globally right now. We_t_re still on the edge_co_ and this is a great place to be as the rest of the world will be playing catch up soon. _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jessepmason","Date":"2015-12-16T03:17:24Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_@dbawel  thanks for sharing that info!

The only rendering process I_t_ve been working with lately is Light Field Rendering (LFR)_co_ or attempting to emulate or build an efficient optimized model/process to emulate LFR. LFR is the way that natural light is reflected and/or absorbed on physical objects in the real world_co_ and why Magic Leap displays are completely natural and realistic to the human eye - far beyond any 2D or 3D simulated renderer. No one has ever seen anything like this_co_ unless you_t_ve actually used the Magic Leap prototypes - which there are only two currently - one at Magic Leap_t_s home office in Florida_co_ and one at Weta in NZ.\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\t \n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\tI can_t_t say much else at this time_co_ however_co_ those of you who know me on this forum_co_ know that I_t_ve been saying I believe this technology will truly and dramatically change the world as we know it_co_ and far more than any other invention in the last few decades. So if you want to better understand the future of rendering and displays_co_ study Light Field Rendering. As for now_co_ what DK_co_ David_co_ and others (I_t_m not certain who else contributed)_co_ what they have currently developed as the PBR renderer looks fantastic! And I_t_m really looking forward to personally understanding the renderer better and the functions we might add in the future to achieve even more realism in the BJS rendering engine. For anyone who is reading this_co_ you are definately in the right place and working with the framework and standards of the future_sm_ the near future - which is really taking off globally right now.

However_co_ I_t_ve been personally fortunate to work directly with Richard Taylor who owns Weta and sits on the board of Magic Leap - and who introduced me to Magic Leap_t_s display device and technology over 4 years ago. As there are only two of their devices currently in existence_co_ I have also had the unique fortune to be one of a handful of people to ever have the experience of viewing imagery through a device projecting light fields diectly onto my retina. And I cannot divulge how the device works due to strict NDAs_co_ however_co_ they are able to manufacture head mounted displays which seperate from the processing unit weigh in at only a few ounces - which if I were able to explain how they are able to reduce what is now 50 lbs down to approximately 5 ounces_co_ and as I was describing to DK_co_ it belongs in a Star Trek world as it_t_s so far beyond belief once you undrstand how they are building the components required for such complex projection.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_line-height_dd_1.6_sm__qt__gt_So only once you understand the required components and how they are manufactured_co_ only then can you begin to comprehend how we might build the authoring environment and rendering application for such a device. I was working with Mental Images (a German company) in the late 1980s and early 1990s on ray traced rendering when it was a brand new technology and mostly theoretical and on paper at the time - similar to what LFR is currently - wrapping my head around actually building an authoring API and renderer for light field projection was a huge challenge mentally for myself personally. And this is after reading many of the white papers on building an LFR application. And I can also tell you that if you read the patents filed by Magic Leap which are available (many are not yet available online)_co_ I doubt these will provide you with any practical information on how the applications in development actually function._lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_line-height_dd_1.6_sm__qt__gt_So all that I wanted to say in my post was that I_t_m very impressed with PBR_co_ and that I recommend at some point that the user community should begin looking at what LFR is as once Magic Leap hits the market_co_ EVERYTHING CHANGES. Oculus and all of the other un-natural _qt_3D_qt_ display devices will die entirely with the exception of social experiences such as feature films for a time_co_ as LFR is highly computationaly expensive_co_ and it will take time for all media industries to catch up - but they will much faster than anyone might expect. By the time Magic Leap releases their first head mounted display_co_ processors will be many times faster than today_co_ as the new processing technologies are lightning fast and are required to render quality LFR in real time. So it will be post rendered media for a short time until the entertainment industries catch up. But once you get a taste of a true LFR display_co_ there is nothing that will compare_co_ and you_t_ll throw out every stereoscopic display. Mark Zuckerburg has already distanced himself from Oculus_co_ and obviously he hasn_t_t spent much time at all discussing his huge mistake in spending 2 billio dollars for existing technology - which by the way_co_ the founder of Oculus was my PA at Emersion Technologies_co_ and we happened to have been building stereoscopic displays for the military - so I wonder where he got his ideas from_co_ hmmm...._lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_line-height_dd_1.6_sm__qt__gt_So again JohnK_co_ thanks for understanding what I was trying to say_co_ and why I might have been a little annoyed by comments from someone with no applied knowledge that I_t_m aware of - and I can generally say this as I know most all of the players in applied LFR development._lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_span style_eq__qt_line-height_dd_1.6_sm__qt__gt_@Nuitari -  To produce an actual definition of LFR requires far more than a sentence or paragraph_co_ and I was mentioning this briefly as I_t_m very impressed by the work done on PBR within the babylon.js framework currently being developed - and I wanted to comment that the BJS community should begin looking at LFR in the future to stay ahead of the other frameworks which are competing with babylon.js - just as we were working on the babylon.js stereoscopic camera in late 2014.
