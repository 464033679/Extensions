Part of my test scene involves a helicopter going around in a circle_co_ so in blender i created a bezierCircle_co_ parented the helicopter to it and set the parenting mode to follow path. In blender this works great when running the animation.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe big problem is of course (I soon discovered) that the babylon exporter does not support beziercircles and therefore ignores the path and the helicopter model (since it is now a child object of the beziercircle).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo my question is_sm_ what is the expected way to set up things like follow path animations in Blender such that the babylon exporter will support it and babylon can play the animations automatically?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div

However after completing one full pass of the baked animation it looks like the object _qt_unwinds_qt__co_ that is to say it spins on the spot 360 degrees and then continues to repeat the animation. It does this twice_co_ and on the third pass simply keeps following the path like I expected it would in the first place. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tProblem 2_dd_ I actually have two simple animations in my scene_co_ both using curves to generate movement along a path for two separate objects. Using animation baking I have baked the animations of each object and i can see both objects in the dope sheet as separate animation keyframe actions. Running the animation in Blender works fine_co_ everything as you would expect. When i export to babylon however_co_ both objects are combined in to one and they begin following the first path. When complete_co_ both objects move to the position of the second object (as it was in blender) and start the second animation. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFeels like I_t_m missing an important step or three here_co_ and it is essential I get animations working smoothly for my 3d piece otherwise the whole thing will fail and I_t_ll be in a world of pain. FYI to create the keyframes I first pick the object i want to animate (which is parented to the curve i want it to follow)_co_ then pick Object -&gt_sm_ Animation -&gt_sm_ Bake Action. From the bake sheet I sent frames 0-100 and checkbox the first 4 options. I_t_ve attached a grab to visualise this.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ve also attached the blend files if someone can take a look_sm_ test_scene is the scene before any animation baking so you can see the original setup. Test_scene2 is after baking the helicopter animation so you can see my process. I_t_ve also added both exported babylon scenes online so you can visualise my issues_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//snou.to/tests/babylonjs/animation/test2/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//snou.to/tests/babylonjs/animation/test1/_lt_/a_gt_ - this is just the helicopter animating (problem 1)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//snou.to/tests/babylonjs/animation/test2/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//snou.to/tests/babylonjs/animation/test2/_lt_/a_gt_ - this is both the helicopter and the ferris wheel (which is just a squashed sphere) animating.
