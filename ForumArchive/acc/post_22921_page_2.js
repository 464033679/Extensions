But if you really want to know my personal opinion_co_ I personally wouldn_t_t approve this animation for release - as for me the quality of the animation is distracting enough to detract from the gameplay. Especially the feet sliding on the floor_co_ which you might improve within your pose interpolation tool_co_ as this will become more of an issue when you begin adding shadows to your scene_co_ as the placement of the character in the environment will suffer far worse than what is currently observed in your scene now_co_ as your character will appear to be floating at times. And in my opinion_co_ the time saved in production by using your tool doesn_t_t justify the resulting quality of animation. And any _qt_character_qt_ style in your animation is also lost as there is no unique character to the animation. But again_co_ this is simply my own personal opinion_co_ as I would personally be distracted enough to avoid playing. Especially since we can very quickly create quality character animation and move trees using 2 or more Kinect V2 devices (even one is sufficient) plugged into my laptop to generate whatever motions I require with little effort in little time - and under $400 for 2 of these currently on Ebay.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut again_co_ this is all very subjective_co_ and I_t_m simply being honest concerning my personal opinions and experience.
