I was a hobbyist learning blender for about 6 years before going back to school for IT - not animation. I have a really good understanding of blender and have the knowledge of a 3D generalist.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have a mechanical model rigged and working in blender. I have attempted many exports with the babylonjs exporter and have had varying degrees of success. It seems like BJS can only recognize a parenting relation so deep - that after a certain hierarchy it loses track of the relationships - which doesn_t_t make any sense to me atm. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe rig is rather complicated and has many bones (288). I read somewhere on these forums that a rig should not have more then 40 bone but many rigs can be used in a scene.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI started to break up my rig into multiple smaller rigs - everything still works in blender \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo to my question..........\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tskeleton A_dd_   skeleton[0]. _range property has a value. I can console.log the ranges_co_ as well as see them in both the babylon.log file and in the .babylon file_co_ so the exporter is working as expected \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tskeleton B_dd_ skeleton[1]. _range property has a value. I can console.log the ranges_co_ as well as see them in both the babylon.log file and in the .babylon file_co_ so the exporter is working as expected \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tskeleton A_dd_   var Top_Down _eq_ newScene.beginAnimation(getArm2_co_ 220_co_ 282_co_ true)_sm_  starts the animation and works as expected \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tskeleton B_dd_ var Claw_Open _eq_ newScene.beginAnimation(getArm_co_ 0_co_ 62_co_ true)_sm_  starts the animation and works as expected \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo both animations on the two different skeletons work_co_ here_t_s the kicker_co_ skeleton B is parented to skeleton A_co_ but doesn_t_t follow the parent. When skeleton A rotates in world space_co_ skeleton B is supposed to inherit the rotation in world space_co_ but doesn_t_t.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t I can see that the babylon exporter respects some parenting relationships (mesh parented to armature) but it seems like the babylon exporter can_t_t / doesn_t_t recognize one armature parented to another.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tblender allows me to parent an armature to a second.........I can parent to the object datablock_co_ armature datablock or a specific bone. The exporter doesn_t_t seem to recognize any option.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have also tried using a child of constraint - skeleton B is a child of skeleton A - to no success.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAt the risk of sounding like a braggart_co_ I know how to use blender and it is not my lack of understanding in that area_co_ so am I asking something from the exporter that it isn_t_t currently able to do?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
