I_t_m very happy to read that you and other people seriously are trying to get good results with VR-Headsets. It_t_s quite obviously that babylon could be a nice technology to get cool things running easily on those devices. For now I only have a Samsung Gear VR equipped with a Galaxy S7. I_t_m working as a screen-designer in a german company and there I am developing some 3D-solutions with Babylon (previously with Three) for our customers. Unfortunately I_t_m not sure that we can provide some really professional solutions with the Gear VR and Babylon within the Samsung Browser. Thank you for the PG-example. I_t_ve tried it but it shows exactly the _qt_wrong_qt_ kind of view (in my mind). So first I have to ask what kind of 3D-View-fullscreen-Version of the browser do you use for it? The _qt_360 2D_qt_ seems to work_co_ the _qt_360 3D-SBS (side by side)_qt_ not really. Although I thought that the 3D-sbs mode should be the right one. Nevertheless there are so many parameters within babylon that are not well documented. The different camatypes are clear. But there are also VRCameraMetrics and I don_t_t know exactly if I should use them to configure my 3D scene to my device (resolution and so on). By the way - I already tried to tweak my camera with metrics but it didn_t_t change anything. And there are some strange distortions that I cannot get under control for now. The camera is also so _qt_shaky_qt_ because the gyroscope is so sensitive (only in the browser_co_ not within the oculus-app). So I still have to tweak my scene a lot to get it onto the professional level. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut I will definetly continue to work on that technology to get better results. As you already mentioned_co_ the technology is still at it_t_s beginning and so I am (with babylon and VR-devices). So I am excited as you about what will come _dd_-)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jellix","Date":"2016-07-03T15:07:51Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/12544-ozrocker/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_12544_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/12544-ozrocker/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@ozRocker_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tthanks_co_ this looks nice.
