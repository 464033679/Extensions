Does the depth percission decreese with VSM? Because we are storing depth and depth squared but have the same amout of bits as oposed to only store the depth_co_ which means we store our values with less precision_co_ correct? I know that when checking for shadows in VSM its not just comparing two depth values (I am honest and tell you_co_ I couldnt fully understand the whole math going on with vsm _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt_true_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ ) but it still seems to me_co_ that the more bits available to store the values_co_ the better?!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWould be cool if someone could enlighten me here _sm_ )\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-02-08T19:37:49Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou_t_re correct.
