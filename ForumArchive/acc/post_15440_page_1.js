I added the diffuseColor and the diffuseTexture and then set the diffsueTexture.hasAlpha to true. I assumed the texture would be over the color... but it ain_t_t. The texture gets tinted and where the texture has transparency the mesh is transparent... but that_t_s not what I want _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_tongue.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_P_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Here is a playground where I tired.
