In my scene I have a table and a chair and I have a box which I checked the check for collision option. In addition I also added a rigid body to said box acting as the bounding box object._lt_br_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The next thing I did was use the babylon sandbox to test out my scene and when the camera collides with the bounding box it _qt_jitters_qt_ or shakes violently. I wanted to know if there was anything else I needed to to in order to get smooth collision between the camera and the bounding box?

I figured out what the issue was with my collision. Basically what I needed to do in blender 3D was to remove the rigid body from my models and make sure I leave the check collision option. These are static models so they will not bounce or ricochet when the user collides with them. They are there to stop the user from going through them.  _lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
