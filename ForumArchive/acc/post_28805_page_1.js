I have been playing with babylon actions_co_ pickResults etc using the mouse pointer_co_ and now I was trying to get the mesh that is in the camera view trajectory so I can trigger actions or activate behaviours. I have tried using Babylon.Ray and looking around the documentation with no luck_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have been also testing React VR_co_ and it has event binding to the meshes on the scene.
