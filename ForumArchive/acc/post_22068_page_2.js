I was always confused by the public production arm of the US government whose initials are WETA. Weta Workshop was started by Richard Taylor and Peter Jackson in the late 80s_co_ and Jamie Selkirk joined as the 3rd founder shortly following their first film _qt_Meet the Feebles._qt_ It_t_s a dirty puppet film_co_ and worth watching - however_co_ their next film _qt_Brain Dead_qt_ is in my opinion_co_ the best zombie movie ever made. But when they began working on _qt_The Frightners_qt_ which is also a great film_co_ they hired 8 animators working in what is now the kitchen of Weta Workshop. However following Frightners_co_ they expanded their digital workshop and moved into the building next door_co_ which now has grown into more than 500 artists working between Weta Workshop and Weta Digital full time_co_ along with Weta Productions founded in 2005 for television production. Not to mention an entire film studio which size and function rivals any studio in Hollywood known as Stone Street.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTo date_co_ Weta has now contributed to the visual effects and creative design for more than 100 movies_co_ including Lord of the Rings_co_ Avatar_co_ Hobbit_co_ King Kong_co_ the Avengers_co_ Narnia_co_ and practically any film of good quality effects you_t_ve probably seen. And FYI - they beat ILM in many tests for film work_co_ including Avatar - which the shots that came out of Avatar frm ILM were really bad before Jim was _qt_encouraged_qt_ to switch to Weta for all design and productio - but that_t_s another story.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBy the way_co_ a Weta is one of the nastiest insects in the world_co_ and I would be woken up at least once every couple of months with one of these very large nasty insects chewing on my arm or leg.

Any reason why this is the case? It wuld be valuable to know why this is occuring. And for Magic Leap and rendering light fields_co_ this is a task which is unbelievably difficult. I wouldn_t_t expect babylon.js to integrate a light field renderer due to the obsene amount of computation_co_ as well as the yet unsolved complexities. But since their busines is selling hardware and displays and not selling software_co_ they are developing the renderer first_co_ and then require an API (or compatability in format) for setting up and/or adapting environments/scenes to be processed by the renderer. The amount of processing is so labor intensive at this time that there is no way of currently rendering in real-time_co_ but I might expect that processors might be fast enough in 2 years to potentially handle this_co_ or make the rendering a fast post process. So I don_t_t know if babylon is a potential choice for them in the future_co_ as I_t_m simply trying to convince them that WebGL is not going away_co_ and we can hopefully support WebGL frameworks such as babylon scenes_co_ as they will find themselves supporting a proprietary API forever_co_ when this is not their business model at all - except for setting up rendering. The person heading up the software and hardware development actually mentioned WebGL to me as a possibility first_co_ almost 2 years ago now - but he_t_s not yet convinced that this is the future for gaming and apps. Autodesk recently anounced and is now pouring millions upon millions into webGL_co_ so there is a plausible future for babylon.js to play a role in the new frontier of natural 3D and 4D natural light displays.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor more info on light field rendering_co_ the following link will provide you with a small glimpse into what they are up against_co_ and you_t_ll see that for them it_t_s all about the renderer in support of CGI scenes_co_ and not the API or development framework - to a point.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a
