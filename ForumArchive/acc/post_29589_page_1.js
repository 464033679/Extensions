looping animations.  I_t_ve created a scene in Maya that I can export an FBX out of.  It seems like the FBXExporter isn_t_t respecting fractional frames or something.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt_\n\tFor the sake of simplicity_co_ say I_t_m trying to move a cube on the X axis from 0 to 5 and have that loop every 20 frames.  On frame 0 and on frame 20_co_ the X value would be at 0_co_ but at frame 19 the frame would be at 5.  This seems fine in Maya since playback only hits the frames on the whole number_co_ but when I export this animation via FBX to Unity for example_co_ the animation curve is sampled between 19 and 20 and it looks like the cube flies back to 0 from 5 really fast instead of it being a _qt_pop_qt_ back to its original starting value_co_ which would give the intended illusion of a loop.  I_t_ve tried to remedy this by changing the last frame from 19 to 19.995_co_ and this seems to look fine when I export and preview the animation in Unity but it still looks awkward in BJS.  I_t_ve got other animations going on in the timeline so I can_t_t just animate a single animation cycle and then set the animation playback to loop.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt_\n\tThe reason why I need to do this is so that I can put the timing of some animations into an animator_t_s hands and keep them out of code land.  I realize I could say in code to just play a specific range of the animation clip and then loop it a certain number of times_co_ but that takes the control of the timing away from the animator.  I intend to have this animation play in sync with an audio clip_co_ so the timing is very important.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt_\n\tAnyone have an idea of what I could try to do to fix this problem?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div

I_t_m not being clear.  I understand what you_t_re saying here and this would work if I were making only a single cycle that I am then looping.  The animation loop I_t_m looking to create is inside of an animation curve with other animations happening at other places on the timeline.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf this were to be a single animation that I could loop over one cycle_co_ I could animate frame 0-19 and then only play back those frames and have it loop only those frames.  What I have is an animation over 0-19_co_ the same exact animation from 20-39_co_ the exact same animation from 40-59_co_ 60-79_co_ 80-99_co_ etc etc and then between frames 200-400 I_t_ve got an entirely different animation going on.  I could just loop the small 0-19 section for x seconds_co_ but x seconds is going to change depending on the audio clip we need to sync our animation to.  We need to be able to hit play on the animation and the sound clip and have it line up exactly with out a programmer (me!) having to go back and change at exactly which time each animation clip is supposed to fire off each time we iterate on our audio clip.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
