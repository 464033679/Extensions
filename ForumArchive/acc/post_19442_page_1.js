Last year_t_s scene which you posted truly brought tears to my eyes and is still a classic for me - as I_t_m also certain it must be for others as well. I can_t_t truly explain how much it means to me to feel as though I_t_m a part of something greater than just a community of users here on the HTML5 Game Developers Forum._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In your most recent post_co_ I really enjoyed being able to explore the rooms and all of the drawers and cabinets_co_ and found the composition books where each poem was read outload with good clarity. I_t_m not certain if there was animation I missed when I was told to close each book after the poem was complete_co_ but perhaps this was just to keep the scene from producing any conflicts resulting from within your scripts. However_co_ I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the scene and it_t_s simple animations - of course_co_ including the clock_co_ the poems_co_ and the playable wax vernacular cylinder from the victrola sitting on the tabletop. And as you did last year_co_ thank you for producing another Christmas scene this year which is quite a nice offerring and again brought a smile to my face._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I debated writing this next paragraph as part of this post_co_ but I thought it might be appropriate under the circumstances_co_ as we have created a GoFundME page which my family is asking for any kind assistance anyone might be able to provide to help with medical bills we have been accumulating in helping my Mother in Law to treat her bone and spinal cancer - which we will begin her treatment this Friday on Christmas day. I am picking up my Wife and Mother in law at the airport (LAX) tomorrow at around 12 noon_co_ and am driving them both directly to a hospital in Playa (Tijuana)_co_ Mexico_co_ which is one of the very best in the world named _qt_Oasis of Hope_qt_ - which you can find at _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.oasisofhope.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.oasisofhope.com/_lt_/a_gt_ which is her only hope in possibly treating her stage IV cancer_co_ and is the only hospital world wide which is even willing to attempt treatment for a woman in her 70s and in her condition - so we are praying and certainly hoping for a miracle. And I was waiting to show her gryff_t_s scene as it will certainly bring a smile to her face_co_ and especially the beautiful scene from last year. And to make matters even slightly worse_co_ my Wife_t_s cat whom she loves almost as much as her Mother has had a stroke this past Tuesday -  and this cat really does like to hear music and truly responds very happily to music - so I know her cat will enjoy the scenes very much. I know this sounds more than a bit absurb_co_ but I_t_m really not exagerating_co_ as this cat rolls around on the ground and also rubs up against people when she hears a song she really likes - as this is some of the stangest animal behavior I have ever personally seen. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_We certainly have much more hope for my Wife_t_s Mother_t_s health_co_ although the doctors told us that we would have to put her cat to sleep by now as the cat was paralized from her neck down following her stroke - but she has had her own miracle_co_ and is now able to stand a bit on her own now_co_ and may actually recover - although the doctors report that this truly is a medical miracle which they have never seen before under any circumstance.  I_t_m only mentioning this on a game geveloper_t_s site since I will be spending the holidays by myself_co_ and welcome all posts and specifically the one_t_s gryff has posted here as it improves my and my Wife_t_s days such as today when I got my first chance to view this new link and t revisit the fantastic one from last year. So thank gryff again this year_co_ as my day has been made much better by the time spent building and posting these Christmas cards_co_ as this really does make us all feel just a little bit better than without them._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_If anyone reading this is able to donate any amount to our Mother_t_s medical care_co_ the link to the GoFundMe website to donate is_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.gofundme.com/6759urvc_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.gofundme.com/6759urvc_lt_/a_gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The pictures you_t_ll find in the link are of my very lovely Wife Aura_co_ and of her Mother - as well as some pictures of her family from this past Thanksgiving in Thailand. I am American_co_ but as I_t_ve mentioned in many posts in the past on this forum_co_ I have had the very great fortume of being able to work all around the world in the film industry and on many other projects - where on one specific trip in 2009_co_ I was so very fortuate to meet my terrific Wife Aura and her family who have all been so very kind to me over the years. I was to never get married and fought against this all my life - until I met her. However_co_ we have now virtually depleted all of our savings and resources in caring for her Mother_co_ as well as her Father and my Father who both passed away from cancer in the past 10 years_co_ and to also cover my Mother_t_s medical expenses these past 5 years from the very same cancer Aura_t_s Mother has developed which is bone cancer - however_co_ as a citizen of the US and having the very best health care available to her_co_ my Mother is in remission_co_ and is currently doing very well due to the quality of care in America. However_co_ we cannot afford Aura_t_s Mother_t_s care here in the US_co_ and if we did have the choice_co_ I would still choose to pay for the private care for my Mother in Law in Mexico_co_ as this hospital is fantastic_co_ and has a verified remission rate 3 times what the remission rate for treatment is in the Us. So if you or anyone in your family ever must face what we are currently facing for our Mother_t_s health_co_ I highly recommend looking closely at this hospital in Playa_co_ Mexico - as I would go there myself if it were me who was diagnosed with cancer. So I hope that this information might help anyone who might be facing this for a friend_co_ family member_co_ or themserlves in the future - God forbid._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_My sincerest apologies for bringing in this as part of a post which was to focus on a fantastic Chrstmas scene built for all of us to enjoy by the talented artist and deveper gryff_co_ and I hope I didn_t_t take this to a place which is completely inappropriate. If so_co_ I_t_m so very sorry_co_ as I really never meant to mention any of the above - but sometimes these things just come out sometimes when writing late at night and having to face all I have to deal with at this time._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Merry Christmas to everyone in the babylon.js community and I and my Family wish you all the very best of wishes this holiday season.
