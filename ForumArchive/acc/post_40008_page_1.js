I would like to know about the performance differences between the stated mesh rendering techniques_co_ and whether or not it is worth it for certain situations.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTL_sm_DR_dd_ What is the performance difference between GPU instances and Mesh clones? Do mesh clones have a noticeable performance increase over standard individual mesh creation?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy individual situation is thus_dd_ I have a series of blocks the user can walk on and place at will_co_ that upon placement will never scale_co_ rotate_co_ or move. However_co_ ideally they should be easy to individually destroy and the user should be able to change their color. The latter seemingly invalidates GPU instances_co_ and the former makes batching appear less reasonable. The only other performance option I_t_ve found is cloning_co_ which is listed as an alternative to GPU instances on the optimization pages_co_ but doesn_t_t say much beyond that. Is it worth it performance-wise to switch to Mesh.clone_co_ or should I instead just go with single instances as I did previously? Any specific suggestions for performance on my situation in general?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jerome","Date":"2018-09-15T06:04:36Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/solid_particle_system_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/solid_particle_system_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"narkro555","Date":"2018-09-15T21:31:43Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_blockquote class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_qt_ data-ipsquote_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipsquote-contentapp_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentclass_eq__qt_forums_Topic_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentcommentid_eq__qt_228169_qt_ data-ipsquote-contentid_eq__qt_40008_qt_ data-ipsquote-contenttype_eq__qt_forums_qt_ data-ipsquote-timestamp_eq__qt_1536991476_qt_ data-ipsquote-userid_eq__qt_5453_qt_ data-ipsquote-username_eq__qt_jerome_qt__gt_\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_citation_qt__gt_\n\t\t15 hours ago_co_ jerome said_dd_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsQuote_contents_qt__gt_\n\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/solid_particle_system_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/solid_particle_system_lt_/a_gt_\n\t\t_lt_/p_gt_\n\t_lt_/div_gt_\n_lt_/blockquote_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tExactly what I was looking for.
