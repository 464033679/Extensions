The editor app can edit a single xml node or json prop_co_ or an entire document of xml nodes (entire json/php object).  The doc/node creator just classifies the node(s)... textblock_co_ codeblock_co_ codeinline_co_ textinline_co_ imageblock_co_ imageinline_co_ etc.  Those are the element names And data class types)... we can make-up any xml element names we want.  It_t_s _lt_u_gt_our_lt_/u_gt_ markup language._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_If each doc is a json/php object_co_ that object carries a template with it... that tells the intended order of data (and which data is included). _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_20 years back when we were making moo objects into html and vrml_co_ we used two props called .hassembly and .vassmbly.  Each was an array of strings or identifiers... that was the ORDER used to present the data in the markup... and it also told WHICH data on the object... was to be marked-up.  We used methods called html() and vrml() as our markup-type determiners.  Call object.html()_co_ and you get html markup representing the object.  Same with object.vrml() for a vrml markup.  All dynamically generated... only when browsed-for.  No static .md anywhere._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Ice_co_ the problem with your idea... is that the BD proggers are converting all the .ts to .md in a pre-done batch pass.  Instead of this_co_ they would need to make the .ts into objects_co_ and then each object could have a .toXML()_co_ and .toMD()_co_ and why not a .toWebGLDynamicTexture() for those who want to read docs while being inside their virtual worlds.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Using this method_co_ just think of the power of language translation we would have_co_ if we wanted to use it.  On the fly translation of text blocks and picture captions... to any language. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Yes_co_ XML still has its drawbacks_co_ and let it be known that I would be perfectly happy with all .md_co_ but we sure lose a ton of power by doing it that way.  This converting of .ts to .md doesn_t_t seem to come up for discussion and pondering.  In BD1_co_ it was just plain done that way.  In BD2_co_ again_co_ it_t_s just plain done that way_co_ and nobody seems to have a say in that move. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Once they hard code BD into being that way_co_ there_t_s no chance for recovery.  It could have been a huge mistake_co_ but nobody is checking it for being a huge mistake.  It_t_s called being _qt_railroaded_qt_ into a certain way of doing things_co_ and I_t_d really like to ask the person who thought it up... if we are allowed to try to convince them of a better way._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_m just a fart in a windstorm as far as being a worthy expert in these matters.  I_t_m far from an XML/XSL pro.  Thank you to John and Ice for at least trying to weigh XML fairly and consider it_t_s power.  I_t_ll be plenty happy with an all-markdown solution... IF XML gets fair weighing and possible future consideration.  It starts... by NOT converting the .ts into markdown.  Please store them as .ts-generated PHP or JSON _lt_u_gt_objects_lt_/u_gt_... which can output markdown at browse time_co_ not pre-batch.  By doing on-the-fly markup generation_co_ we AT LEAST have a future chance of using markup other than .md. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Any chance?  Thanks.  By the way_co_ don_t_t take me too seriously.  I might huff and puff during a campaign to get a change made_co_ but I_t_m not seriously emotional over this issue.  Temechon and crew have done us well_co_ but I still get to question the logic behind certain things.  It_t_s one of the inalienable rights of having a typing machine_co_ right?  Temechon_co_ you can concentrate on tsDocObj.toMD() and continue your efforts without the batch conversion. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I guess you_t_ll still do a batch run on the .ts_co_ but they_t_ll be made into objects_co_ not .md documents.  Consider it?  Please?  Someday later_co_ if nobody else codes it_co_ I will code tsDocObj.toXML() and .toHTML()_co_ as wanted. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_This is Iceman_t_s idea... not mine.
