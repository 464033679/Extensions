Think if i wanted to create a mini-map_co_ but to achieve this all i was doing was putting a camera way above the land looking down. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMaybe best way to explain is please look at my example.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1QXZAA%231_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1QXZAA#1_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is what i am trying to achieve. A second camera is looking at the same object but from a different angle. However_co_ when you move the main camera with the mouse so that the objects in it are now positioned over the bottom left overlay_co_ the objects go over top of my camera2 viewport since the objects are closer to camera1 then they are to camera2(z-buffering). How can i achieve this so that my bottom left overlay is always on top? is there a better way than view ports? like rendering the camera2_t_s view to a texture that just overlays the canvas? Also_co_ i had to create a third camera to force a white background on the viewport. Maybe there is a better way to do this?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks for any advice on how to proceed!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ChrisR","Date":"2016-01-14T00:21:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOk_co_ so continuing looking into this_co_ i have tried to just take a screen shot of the camera every time and place it on a dom element.
