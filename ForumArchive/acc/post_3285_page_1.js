Thank you._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I_t_m sorry that it_t_s not the feeling I gave you. I was only suggesting to improve the way we communicate on this forum_dd_ I would prefer to quickly go to the best answer containing the key part of the code (not the full function or all the functions of the application) which puts people on the good track to resolve their problems and after that read code examples (or link to code examples) such as your index.html. I_t_m also suggesting to provide a link to people only if this link won_t_t be broken later on or if its contents won_t_t change. I noticed your index.html doesn_t_t show the same thing than you posted it as best answer on January 23. Maybe it_t_s not bad at all to understand this topic but it could be if its content is not linked to this topic anymore_co_ that_t_s why I_t_m suggesting to copy-paste key part of the code of index.html and set it as best answer since this part won_t_t change even if you modify the content of index.html or remove this page._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Of course all of this it_t_s only my suggestion_co_ all of us can do whatever we want but we all want to share our experience and help people so we implicitly adopt conventions. Writting in English is one of them and setting the key part of the code as best answer could be another one._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Thank you._lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Dad72","Date":"2014-02-18T14:14:27Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Hi Gwenaël_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I understand your point of view Gwenaël.
