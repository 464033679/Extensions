A mesh can have multiple facets (faces). From the camera point of view_co_ only one among these facets are most accessible. (I mean_co_ the least angle that the camara has to rotate to hit this facet with its ray). How can I achieve it?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2. How to place a mesh (may be a cylinder with very less height which looks like a push button) just above (closer to camera) and parallel to a facet of another mesh?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t3. I have a Disc mesh (created with MeshBuilder.CreateDisk). The ray is not picking it.

Not sure to understand your need. Can you create a Playground to demonstrate what you are looking for?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2. If you get the facet from a ray picking info you can easily attach your mesh as child of the other mesh and use the pickingInfo.pickedPoint to determine where to put your mesh.
