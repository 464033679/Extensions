As usual I have more questions than answers...\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe idea is to move the camera to a position in front of a chosen mesh within the scene. I_t_ve got a very simple scene going where_co_ upon detecting a click_co_ I create a follow camera_co_ set its position and rotation to the active arc camera_co_ then define the camera target and let it animate to it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSome questions on this approach_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t1) There_t_s a shift in position when switching active cameras from arc to follow. Any reason for this? I set position and rotation to match_co_ but I must be missing something else from the arc camera when switching to the follow camera. Lets face it_co_ I usual am._lt_br /_gt_\n\t2) Detecting a click is a bit of a pain. Not in itself_co_ but when it comes to determining if the user was rotating the scene with the mouse button_co_ or actually clicking a mesh in the scene_co_ when releasing the mouse button it_t_s less than clear. Are there any recommended strategies to follow for this? I looked at the ActionManager example PG (_lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/?17_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/?17_lt_/a_gt_) but it has the same issue_sm_ if you click down over one of the shapes_co_ move the scene around a bit with the mouse button still down_co_ then move the scene so the original clicked object is under the mouse when you release the button_co_ it_t_s considered a click. Seems obvious to me there should be some clear method to distinguish the two actions_co_ but don_t_t ask me what the solution is because i don_t_t have a scooby._lt_br /_gt_\n\t3) Is there a way to detect when the follow camera finishes animating to the target?

It_t_s interesting that your approach seems to have a higher threshold for ignoring ground clicks than my demo did_co_ so I_t_ll try implementing the actions the same way you did.

So in your test scene you can click over a shape_co_ rotate the camera with the mouse button still down so that the cursor exists the shape_co_ then rotate the camera so the cursor is back over the clicked object_co_ release_co_ and it is detected as a click. That_t_s going to be an issue for me at some point I feel. One might expect there to be a timed check between mouse down and mouse up that determines that _qt_no_co_ the mouse button has been down too long_co_ this can_t_t be a click_qt_ going on behind the scenes in the mouse events_co_ but it doesn_t_t appear to be the case._lt_/font_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_font color_eq__qt_#000000_qt__gt_I dunno_co_ maybe I_t_m worrying too much about that particular issue.
