mentioned earlier_co_ I am becoming convinced that _t_follow_t_ needs something wonderful... like maybe a FollowManager class.  I am dreaming of a system where anything (that has installed a FollowManager) can be told to follow any target.  Your demo is SO CLOSE to being a following ArcRotateCamera_co_ that_co_ it should actually be one (later maybe)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Another issue that was raised recently... was about how a followCamera acts...  when the target banks like an airplane might do.  A FollowManager could have settings for that.  Also_co_ _lt_u_gt_many_lt_/u_gt_ objects could follow a single target mesh... without being children of the target. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But here we are getting into physics... where the mass of each following object... determines its easing characteristics.  It would start to resemble physics _qt_links_qt_ in many ways.  But still_co_ I am seeing some real nice _qt_easing_qt_ happening from AlexB and yourself_co_ and I would love to see what we could get-away-with... in building a _qt_rubber cord_qt_ linking that didn_t_t need a physics engine._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_In a way_co_ camera .inertia is a physics thing... faking camera mass.  .inertia would also be a property on a FollowManager... and would affect easing_co_ one would think.  Inertia would also affect _qt_whip_qt_ / _qt_overshoot_qt_ (if those things were possible at all).  And the velocity of the moved object might be a factor_co_ or could be told to be a factor._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Lots of issues with a FollowManager_co_ though.  Two primary problems are collision and physics (for things that are following)_co_ I suspect.  No concerns for camera and lights that follow (except if they have .inertia).  They can_t_t be physics objects (but their parents can be)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_But following mesh (mesh that follow)... phew.  I suspect we would get some less-than-optimal results if physics objects were allowed to have an active FollowManager.  For example_co_ in joshcamas_t_ demo_co_ what would happen if the avatar was walking along a narrow alley with tall walls on both sides_co_ with camera collision ON_co_ with wall collisions ON... when the avatar turns 180 degrees to go the other way?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Without collisions_co_ the camera would swing-around outside the walls_co_ and if those walls had backfaces_co_ you would lose sight of the avatar (player) until the player completed the turn.  This is related to joshcamas_t_ thoughts about things standing/getting in the way of the view_co_ but in this example_co_ things are also getting in the way of the follow path._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_With collisions ON_co_ who knows what would happen?  As Dad72 mentioned somewhere_co_ collided FreeCameras do slide-alongs when blockages stop the camera.  ArcRotateCameras don_t_t._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Followers are a SUPER handy tool_co_ but_co_ there sure are a ton of issues involved_co_ eh?  _dd_/ And in general_co_ _qt_following_qt_ is not really a _t_framework_t_ issue.  Its a game-maker tool issue.  But ActionManager is similar in that way_co_ so I think we_t_re safe_co_ and I think the Babylon.JS gods are still reading along... although they are likely laughing at Wingnut_t_s goofy dreams.  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_
