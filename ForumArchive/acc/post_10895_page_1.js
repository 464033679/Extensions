forum.  Good to have you with us!_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_    That_t_s an interesting question_co_ but is there long lists of completed games for ANY webGL framework? _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_    This is a rather new technology.  Maybe YOU will become famous as one of the early pioneers of RTS webGL games.  But_co_ others are working on things as well.  Not all of them are in a hurry to give away their code.  Some are hoping to do commercial ventures._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_   ThreeJS framework has been around awhile_co_ and due to its quality and massive demos by MrDoob_co_ AlteredQualia_co_ and Professor Stemkoski_co_ has a fine following.  But ThreeJS has a slightly different purpose than BabylonJS.  ThreeJS is a _qt_thorough_qt_ framework.  It tries to cover all the bases (create a tool for every needed possibility)_co_ and in doing that_co_ it has become overweight and has a steep learning curve_co_ in my humble opinion.  But_co_ it is VERY powerful._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_BabylonJS is much sleaker_co_ and does not include rarely-needed things in its core framework.  AND_co_ it has eliminated some unnecessary steps found in ThreeJS.  To get to the point_co_ BabylonJS is smaller_co_ faster_co_ easier_co_ and if you need something _qt_fancy_qt__co_ BabylonJS has left the door WIDE OPEN to write your own custom JS or shader... to get _qt_rare things_qt_ accomplished just fine.  So_co_ in a way_co_ ThreeJS is a powerful utility tractor with tons of features built-in_co_ and BabylonJS is a Ferrari with tons of _qt_connectors_qt_ where you can add ANY custom feature._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Ok_co_ back to your questions... no_co_ BabylonJS is not as popular as it should be.  But if you take a moment to investigate it_co_ you will find yourself saying _qt_wow!_qt_ very very often.  Do we have completed games?  Some_co_ but not many.  I don_t_t have a list.  But if you take a look at _lt_strong_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_the BabylonJS main website_lt_/a_gt__lt_/strong_gt__co_ you will see many demos that are real close to being games_co_ and ACP Assassin_t_s Creed Pirates... is a game_co_ and a gorgeous one... considering it_t_s all webGL. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_The Train Demo is another _qt_wow!_qt_ demo_co_ inches from being a game.  Hill Valley is wonderful_co_ ready to become a game.  Viper_co_ Spaceship_co_ and Omega Crusher_co_ all perfectly poised to become games.  _qt_Third party_qt_ section has great game-starters like Evasion_co_ Light Speed Ready_co_ Drift_co_ and a few others._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt__lt_strong_gt__lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//pixelcodr.com/index.html_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Temechon_lt_/a_gt__lt_/strong_gt_ and
