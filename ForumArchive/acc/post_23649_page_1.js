I_t_m currently doing my thesis at uni_co_ the topic being web based games (specifically 3d ones). I_t_m going to create a small multiplayer Bomberman clone and reflect the process on the thesis itself_sm_ what problems I had_co_ how does the development compare to for example Unity etc. I have used Unity kind of a lot and know the basics of threejs. However_co_ after many hours I decided to make the game with Babylon_co_ since it seems to be more suitable for the task at hand. I have a strong web-development background_co_ so the thesis pretty much gives me some time to learn more about game programming _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_br /_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\tAh yes the question itself_co_ which is pretty much about setting up the project.

How about drawing up an outline plan of your game showing this module and that module and the other modules asking how this BJS module would communicate with this interface module or something along those lines?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"adam","Date":"2016-07-08T10:34:15Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI use Visual Studio Community Edition_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id_eq_48146_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id_eq_48146_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tInstall and Start VS then\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFile &gt_sm_ New Project &gt_sm_ Templates &gt_sm_ Other Languages &gt_sm_ Typscript\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can install BabylonJS using NuGet or you can download it here_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/dist_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/dist_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tand include it in your project.  Make sure you get the js file and the .d.ts file.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can play around with the samples here_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Samples/tree/master/Demos_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJS/Samples/tree/master/Demos_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
