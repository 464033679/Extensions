I am having a bit of a problem with using my local Babylon bundle in a sample project. I am a web developer by day_co_ and am used to being able to `npm link` a library for local dev. However_co_ a `package.json` file doesn_t_t seem to be in the `/dist` directory after compilation. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI basically have two questions_dd_ \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t1) Is it possible to get the `npm link` method working? I_t_m not sure what exactly should be in this particular `package.json`\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t2) How are others doing local development of Babylon? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-05-24T16:00:19Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou may find this interesting_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//pixelcodr.com/tutos/contribute/contribute.html_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//pixelcodr.com/tutos/contribute/contribute.html_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"brochington","Date":"2016-05-24T17:36:14Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_4442_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/4442-deltakosh/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Deltakosh_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you_co_ it was extremely helpful_co_ and is what I used to get the project compiling.
