So I can make any word at any time and place them into the scene. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTo make a word I load an external file giving offset and center location of the word.

Then I thought maybe I would use the TransformNode but was not sure that would work on an instanced mesh \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo is there something to group some meshes together and rotate them as a group? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI guess I could clone the meshes but that would ad performance hit_co_ right?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-03-05T16:33:13Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn your case I suggest keeping instances as they are by far more performant and only create a parent transform node per word.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tInstances can be parented to a transform node and thus you can manipulate all of them through the parent node\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"chicagobob123","Date":"2018-03-05T17:39:00Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI see..
