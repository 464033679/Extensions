So here_t_s my approach which works well for me - is that I take ful advantage of objects in WebGL (BJS of course)_co_ for many of my GUI elements as WebGL provides me with beautiful and aesthetic user elements which I can then also take advantage of all other native functions and materials - which ends up providing me with very few limitations in creating uniquely functioning _qt_buttons and elements_qt_ way outside _qt_the box_qt_ in functionality.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHowever_co_ for many other reasons including saving screen _qt_real estate_qt__co_ I take full advantage of DOM objects such as forms for lists_co_ info_co_ etc_co_ and launch these from my own code - however I also truly like CastorGUI as he has created a very simple and powerful extension which he has included a nice library of HTML objects which work nicely within the BJS framework.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo my personal approach is to take full advantage of all available objects and methods_co_ and now find that building the GUI can often be some of the most enjoyable tasks within the develpment process. And on a personal note - yes_co_ I_t_m looking forwrd to _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_19199_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/19199-pryme8/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@Pryme8_lt_/a_gt__t_ forthcoming release of PIE - if he ever gets around to finishing it - since what I_t_ve already seen what it is capable in its current limitexd state of develoment is pretty dam cool.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlright_co_ time for that beer... the one that_t_s had my name on it for the past few hours._lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCheers_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDB\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Nockawa","Date":"2016-11-17T09:18:11Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWell_co_ there are no Silver Bullet and people have to understand that Canvas2D is _lt_strong_gt_NOT_lt_/strong_gt_ meant to be a GUI Library_co_ but a 100% WebGL accelerated 2D Engine that will serve as the _lt_strong_gt_foundation_lt_/strong_gt_ for a forthcoming GUI Library.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou can build your own GUI Controls based on Canvas2D_dd_ it was designed to meet this requirement_co_ but it won_t_t be easy.
