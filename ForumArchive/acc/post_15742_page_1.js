doable_co_ and in many ways.  One of the problems is that IF the camera is attached to the canvas_co_ then that camera is also the user_t_s main camera_co_ and your _qt_camera .alpha snapper_qt_ will get in the way of the user doing drag-panning of their main camera.  (.alpha is the property on an arcRotateCamera that pans it around the Y axis).  But you might want more than Y-only rotation.  Read on._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_For our discussion_co_ let_t_s pretend there is a NEXT button or keypress_co_ and that we ARE using the user_t_s main arcRotateCamera.  So_co_ we want to turn the user cam to the NEXT target_co_ but then the user can still do manual drag-panning if they choose.  Sound ok?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Another decision... should the camera go to the next target RIGHT NOW_co_ or should it gently animate to the next target?_lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Animating the camera to the next target (with optional in/out easing of 12 types of interpolator adjustments or write your own interpolation formula)... is a bit more complicated_co_ but looks LOTS prettier when done._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Can you give us some more

continues to thread-end.  It_t_s way way talkie_co_ and likely far more information than you can stand or want.  Generally speaking_co_ meshes_co_ cameras_co_ and lights... have an array property called .animations.  Inside there_co_ you can put BABYLON.Animation-class obects.  Often_co_ they are in there just long enough to complete the animation move_co_ and then they are destroyed.  You CAN re-use stopped animations with our brand new reset() option for animaTIONS and animatABLEs_co_ but I haven_t_t tried it yet.  I_t_m not sure if you can set a new KEYS before the reset().  Such a move is not really RESETting an Animation_co_ but instead re-using it as a DIFFERENT animation... and I_t_m not sure it_t_s possible (unlikely).  But it_t_s easy to dispose() a completed/stopped animation and make a new one... for the NEXT animation to the NEXT target._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So_co_ your nextTarget() function will need to build an animation from camera.target (its current

you can apply those animations to your camera.target. _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_Keep in mind that you can get a handy list of all non-light_co_ non-camera scene items (meshes) that are in

a mesh_co_ camera_co_ or light.  (Many ActionManagers in a single scene_co_ is common.)  That device would make it easy to CLICK-ON (pick) the nextTarget_co_ and the camera will animate to aim at _lt_u_gt_that_lt_/u_gt_ target.  The ActionManager will build the animation/keyFrames FOR you_co_ and/or you can write your own interpolator formula if you like (interpolator _eq_ math/code used to calculate the animation_t_s trajectory).  I am not sure if an ActionManager can use our pre-built easing formulas_co_ but you can copy their code...  into an ActionManager interpolator... maybe.

might be wiser to _qt_outline_qt_ or _qt_showBoundingBox_qt_ or maybe flash the colors... on points of interest... as the user pans.  That way_co_ you aren_t_t stealing camera control_co_ but you are
