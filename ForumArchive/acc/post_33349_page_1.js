Now things get complicated quite quickly - you want to rotate a little bit about the local z axis (roll) as you rotate a little bit about the local y axis (yaw) to bank the plane. However rolling causes the local y axis to go off vertical and so any yawing about the local y axis will turn the local z axis up or down and so the plane will fly upwards or downwards and to keep the z axis level to the ground you need to pitch as well.
