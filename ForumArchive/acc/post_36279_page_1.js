The Gamelets are starting points for ideas using Babylon.js and as such were written as explorations and are about potential rather than efficiency and effectiveness. As Jerome said the PG is CPU intensive and time is of the order(N*N) where N is the number of balls_co_ so for time of order 4 000 000 perhaps 10fps is not too bad for a start.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"onlycape","Date":"2018-03-11T11:32:46Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn my old Athlon x2 with the GTX 650_co_ it runs at 4fps (with 2000 particles_co_ which are a lot _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_). With less than 200 particles I can get 60fps_co_ and with 400_co_ 30fps.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut as you have already been told_co_ the trigonometric calculations of the intersections consume a lot of CPU time.
