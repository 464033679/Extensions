By default it seems to start at the center of the face_co_ and it is not quite what I need - if cube size is not a multiple of grid ratio_co_ cube vertices are not grid points (like so - _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#5S6MD%2315_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#5S6MD#15_lt_/a_gt_).
