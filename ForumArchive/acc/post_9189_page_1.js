Presumably_co_ you want an environment where a player is navigating *through* a forest_co_ correct? There are many sources of free textured models of trees_co_ but they generally fall into one of two categories_dd__lt_/p_gt__lt_ol_gt__lt_li_gt_Fully detailed trees with alpha-textured boughs of leaves &amp_sm_ individual branches_co_ etc. These usually look best_co_ but they are expensive._lt_/li_gt_\t_lt_li_gt_Billboard trees_co_ merely a picture of a tree mapped to a flat plane. These are much faster to render_co_ &amp_sm_ (in many cases_co_) they look just fine._lt_/li_gt__lt_/ol_gt__lt_p_gt_In order to pull off the illusion_co_ you_t_re probably going to want to use a combination of both. Do you have a limited area where the player can move? Use fully-meshed trees there. Fill in the borders with some billboard trees. Most packages will generate a terrain grid for you. Download one you like_co_ or generate one using a _qt_noise_qt_-image as a displacement map._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_There_t_s really no limit to how much you can embellish your forest. Tufts of grass using alpha transparency will add a lot to the ground_co_ &amp_sm_ a sound loop of wind &amp_sm_ birds chirping will go a long ways towards making your forest feel realistic.
