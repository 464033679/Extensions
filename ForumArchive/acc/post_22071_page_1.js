This is so a single mesh could have independent deformations on different parts of it.  Right now in my work_co_ I have 2 groups_co_ FACE &amp_sm_ WINK_co_ and plan on L_HAND &amp_sm_ R_HAND.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is a work in progress.  I will eventually share it as an extension_co_ but I do not have a time table.  Am coming real close to finishing 10k word speech generation using a make human mesh.  Thought about putting out a public link for the speech tool_co_ but since the extension would not also be ready for use might be too much of a tease.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn any case_co_ your shape key animation would not export.  I only generate in-line javascript to represent shape key groups.  No animation is transferred.  I do not believe in the BJS Animation approach.  It is a bulky playback oriented system.  Imagine how many megabytes would be required to stuff 10k words of animation into a .babylon file.  What if there were 5 characters in the scene?\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAfter the shape key code is closed_co_ I need to get the integrated skeleton interpolation working_co_ which should result in a 10X reduction in amount of data transfer.  The exporter will only write out the key frames_co_ not 30 of them per second.  The extension would generate the intermediate frames on the fly according to the frame rate the scene was sustaining.  It will also transfer any translation of the root bone to the meshes position.  This is a very long term project_co_ and if it were easy to do_co_ it would have been complete long ago_co_ sorry.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
