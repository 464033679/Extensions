Now I want to cut this shape out of another mesh (lowest layer in the playground). The result I get is the top layer in the playground_co_ but it_t_s not what I expected it to be like. I assumed I would get a clear path cut out of the lowest layer mesh._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I think the problem is the merging of the meshes. If I turn on the debug layer_co_ with clickable labels and select the merged mesh I can see that it looks like there are still multiple meshes overlapping each other._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_So what am I doing wrong? Am I using the merge wrong? Is there a better way of merging the meshes so that I can get my expected result? I tired to skip the merging and carve each single block out of my lowest layer_co_ but that seemed to have very poor performance (my browser crashed)._lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_ _lt_/p_gt__lt_p_gt_I hope you guys can help me with that!_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jerome","Date":"2015-10-04T10:45:52Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_smells like the monthly challenge #2_co_ doesn_t_t it ?  _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"iiceman","Date":"2015-10-04T10:52:50Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_Yepp_co_ ... and probably nobody is gonna help because everybody wants to win and not helping me winning _lt_img src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt__gt_ ... hmm..
