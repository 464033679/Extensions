And if you give a lot of trays into the lane it could happen that they get stuck because of a _qt_traffic jam_qt_. So t_lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_#272a34_sm__qt__gt_he goal is to simulate the floating process of the trays within a given time._lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo the functional requirements of the modules are_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- every tray has to know the next module it has to go to. The time for that depends on the current module it is running on.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- After it reaches the target it has to go to the subsequent module.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- every tray has to look if the target module is free or if there is already another tray. If so it has to wait until the module is free again.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNow I want to calculate how many trays can run over the lane within one hour. For that I don_t_t want to watch the lane for an hour in realtime but to simulate the floating in a speeded up version. Because of that I need to have kind of a scrubbing bar like in a videoplayer so that I can jump to minute 45 and see the current state of the overall simulation. Therefore it_t_s important that the animation of every tray is not _t_dynamic_t_ and running in realtime but _t_predicted_t_ with start and end values where I can jump to timepoints.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat is the reason why I have a starting position of my tray and a target position of it and a _t_delta_t_position in between related to a given time.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFor now I have developed the lane with modules_co_ the trays and a simulator that manages everything. By using TypeScript it_t_s all programmed in a clean OOP way. Actually the current task is to move the trays like written above.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHope that this explanation helps to understand my question.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Wingnut","Date":"2017-04-01T14:40:53Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThx for the info_co_ Jel.  Good job.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo... can the trays be _qt_smart_qt_?  Self-contained transport motors_co_ with variable speeds_co_ based upon on-board sensors checking if/not the road-ahead is clear?  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDo the trays need to check with ground control and tray traffic control tower... before arriving-at or departing-from a module?  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_wink.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__sm_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOr...  dumb trays_co_ with tray-watching sensors along the conveyor borders_co_ doing traffic management? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAre modules in-touch-with all the trays and other modules... via RF digital link?  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCan modules _qt_see_qt_ the (path-to) modules ahead?  Can they see conveyor _qt_clearness_qt_ to all neighboring modules? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tCan modules place data on the trays... to be used in on-tray programs? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAre the conveyors linear_co_ or are there some branching decisions to be made along the way?   \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLots of questions_co_ huh?  Cool project.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_m trying to figure out if the trays will have batteries and Arduino boards on them_co_ or not.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_D_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  Can the trays build their own animations?  Wow!  FUN! \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBut... predictable (fast-forward/rewind 1+ hour... slider)?   Ouch! \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway_co_ I_t_m just wasting space here.  Smarter people will comment soon...

I will describe the scenario more precisely so some things will get clear.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt is a checkpoint on an airport. Surely you know the lane where you pick up a plastic tray (just a simple box without any electronics inside). There you put in some stuff like mobile phone and so on. Push it manually on the passive rolls onto the first conveyor belt. So here it goes ... straight into the _qt_scanner_qt_ whre the tray stips. the scanner looks for some dangerous stuff in your goods. And an operator checks the taken photo for about 15 - 30 seconds while the next tray is already coming. Maybe there are 150 passengers that all have to get their stuff over the lane. and the operator has to hurry up to get everything in flow.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo the only information is_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- Duration for the tray-movement from one module to the next one (with some random variables).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- number of passengers giving trays into the lane (with a given delay)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn theroy the simulator knows every module at every time and it could _t_think_t_ about the whole scenario. But I would suggest to let every tray act for itself. It just has to know whre it is at the moment and where to go. The simulator (that knows all the modules and trays) handles each tray and looks if the subsequent module is free to let the tray go.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo maybe these are some additional infos to my case _dd_-)\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt is a kind of hobby project at the moment.

WORLDspace/LOCALspace... that makes it more desired than .addInPlace? \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI believe the .addInPlace is worldspace only_co_ but I_t_m not

.translate has a sister method called ._lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/classes/2.5/abstractmesh#rotate-axis-amount-space-rarr-void_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_rotate()_lt_/a_gt_ ?  I_t_m quite sure it uses mesh.rotationQuaternion and not mesh.rotation. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHave you been introduced to Quaternions_co_ yet?  They are another way (other than Vector3 Euler .rotation)... to store mesh rotation.  Using Quaternions is a way to avoid a rotation problem when values approach the mesh_t_s _qt_poles_qt_... called _t_gimbal lock_t_. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBesides using AbstractMesh_t_s .rotate() to set mesh.rotationQuaternion values (quats have 4 values)_co_ there are also some tools that use things like yaw_co_ pitch_co_ and roll. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSomeone once told me (about quats) that the X_co_ Y_co_ and Z values set the direction of an arrow (now place mesh upon arrow shaft so mesh +Z matches arrow direction)_co_ and then the 4th value (sometimes labeled _t_s_t_ or _t_w_t_)... is the amount of mesh rotation AROUND the arrow_t_s shaft.  Strange.  You probably know all this already... sorry.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAlso_co_ anytime a mesh goes physics-engine-active_co_ the mesh and it_t_s physics impostor... always use Quaternions for their rotation.  The mesh.rotationQuaternion property does _lt_u_gt_NOT_lt_/u_gt_ exist_co_ by default.  The BJS engine installs it onto the mesh... if/when needed. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAddInPlace() is a good friend of _t_lerp_t_s... I think (linear interpolations).  Lerps are derived with BJS helper funcs (or do them yourself) which calculate change-divided-by-time.  (Poorly described_co_ sorry.)  Lerps (interpolations) are often used to change a value (like a step-distance) a certain amount... over a certain time-period.  They can include Bezier curves/eases.  Sounds like an animator_t_s best friend_co_ eh?  Those _qt_steps_qt_ might be good values to .position.addInPlace()_co_ right?  hmm.  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tExciting info_co_ huh?  (snore)  _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"}]
