When you create an instance of this Texture you specify the Font Name (using CSS notation)_co_ the owner Scene_co_ the maximum character count you wish to store (beware it_t_s an approximation_co_ but you should always be able to store at least this number) and the filtering mode. Upon creation the basic ASCII characters are automatically added_co_ but you can also add other Unicode Character by calling the getChar method which will add the given character if it doesn_t_t exist or return the corresponding info Object if it does.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tTypical scenario is to parse all characters you want to render and call this method to be sure they are all present in the Map. Then you call the Update method to update (if necessary) the Texture to reflect the latest additions.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tgetCharInfo() return the character position in the map and its width. You also have access to the lineHeight Property which gives you...the height of a line! Finally you have a measureText method which will return the size taken by a given text. Line return and tabulation are supported.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWell_co_ this class is simple and you can use it if you want_co_ but you should be happy with the Text2D primitive in the Canvas2D.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_u_gt__lt_strong_gt_MapTexture_lt_/strong_gt__lt_/u_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis texture is a dynamic implementation of the _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//stackoverflow.com/questions/8762569/how-is-2d-bin-packing-achieved-programmatically_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_2D Bin Packing algorithm_lt_/a_gt_. It_t_s mainly used when you want to store many different bitmap rectangles of different size in a single Texture_co_ for rendering performance_t_s sake.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWe typically use this algorithm to build _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_LightMaps_lt_/a_gt__co_ but I needed it to cache the content of Group2D in the Canvas2D feature.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne thing differentiate this implementation from the algorithm mentioned above_dd_ it_t_s dynamic! You can free elements you allocated!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt_t_s pretty straightforward to use_dd_ the constructor defines the name_co_  the size of the texture_co_ the owner scene and the filtering mode._lt_br /_gt_\n\tThen you call allocateRect(size_dd_ Size) to find a slot to store your data_co_ the returning PackedRect object gives all the information you need. You need to save this object if you want to release this allocation later by calling freeRect(rectInfo_dd_ PackedRect). If null is returned while calling allocateRect() it means the texture has no room to store what you asked for!_lt_br /_gt_\n\tThe freeSpace read-only property returns you the amount of free space in from the range of 0 (totally full) to 1 (totally free). Beware_dd_ due to fragmentation you may not allocate a rect of the corresponding area returned by freeSpace!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThree others methods are very useful_dd_ binTextureForRect/PosSize() and unbindTexture(). Use the first two to bind the texture to the texture as the render Frame Buffer targeting the region specified either by the PackedRect object or a Pos/Size info. Rendering will then be done in this area and this area only. You also have the possibility to clear the area during binding to start fresh! When you_t_re done rendering_co_ just call the unbind method to restore the WebGL state as is was before.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat_t_s all folks!
