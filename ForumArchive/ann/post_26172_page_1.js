(Only just got going really). My original idea was to re-organise the pages of the BJS Docs into a way I preferred. Some of the pages in the Guide are a result of that first idea. Then I came across a questions in the forum that I though I could answer (on rotations) but it turned out my knowledge was not quite up to my own opinion of it. So I set out to try to really understand what it was all about. As I gained understanding (well I think I did) I started to put more explanation in the Guide based on that new understanding which I hope will help others. My aim now is to pick out parts of BJS that interest me_co_ develop my knowledge and add explanations to the guide. Shaders are something I played with once so perhaps I will go for that next. My idea is that the Guide should be complementary to the Docs.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tLike the BJS Docs I generate my pages from MarkDown files which can be found at _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJSGuide/Generator_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//github.com/BabylonJSGuide/Generator_lt_/a_gt__lt_span_gt_ _lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAny feedback is welcome I_t_ll just ignore the bits I don_t_t like_lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_unsure_dd__qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_unsure.png_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_unsure_dd__qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"jerome","Date":"2016-11-02T19:43:00Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\treally great ! _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt__lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"DigiHz Data","Date":"2016-11-02T23:51:41Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tGreat _lt_a contenteditable_eq__qt_false_qt_ data-ipshover_eq__qt__qt_ data-ipshover-target_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/14282-johnk/?do_eq_hovercard_qt_ data-mentionid_eq__qt_14282_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/14282-johnk/_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt_@JohnK_lt_/a_gt_ Keep it up.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Temechon","Date":"2016-11-03T10:05:02Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWow really cool John!

I had thought about putting submitting the pages to the documentation site but personally its organisation does not really suit me. It just seemed less effort to start afresh and organise things my way. It is the nature of open source documentation that it grows organically and given its current size its too large to start re-organising. So while the documentation is really great and I still refer to it all the time really I feel happier just having a great deal of control over organising the content and changing it around should I think of better ways of doing it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAs my pages are in md format_co_ and are accessible from the link in my first post_co_ if anyone wants to pull any pages from there and put them in the documentation site they are welcome to. Though that would mean duplication. Perhaps a link to the guide on the footer of the documentation pages would be a possibility. As I said earlier I do not see the Guide as a replacement for the Documentation but a complement to it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway I am really chuffed by everyone_t_s post and I will keep going albeit slowly.
