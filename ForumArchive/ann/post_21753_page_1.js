Within it you can share existing links to already deployed apps or you can upload your apps directly to my server and a shiny new sub-domain name will be made for people to access it. There are no monthly fees to keep your app online and today I am making it freely available. If you have already deployed your web app and wish to share it_co_ you may register for an account and directly upload an entry to share it on the front page. However if you would like to upload directly to my server you will first have to obtain some storage. To begin you will have to _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//apphut.net/register_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_register_lt_/a_gt__co_ then you will need to follow the _t_developers_t_ link in the header that will take you to your dashboard. There will be _t_hosted_t_ section within the dashboard where you will see options for either purchasing storage or a way for you to input a promo code for free storage. After you have successfully acquired storage you can then proceed to the upload page to upload your app.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI have decided to grant some free storage for you to try out the service. There is no limit to how many you can upload as long as you still have storage and you can upload all types of applications _dd_ games_co_ js utilities_co_ Babylon projects_co_ blogs_co_ tutorials etc. As long as its nothing too obscene or crude.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe promo code for 20 MB of free storage is _lt_strong_gt_webdev_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHopefully you guys can find it useful_co_ if you have any questions please feel free to ask.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2016-04-06T20:19:46Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\t(please note that Alan asked me permission to do this post.

You cannot run server side scripts but you certainly can communicate with other servers (as long as CORS is enabled). There is a platform named _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.pubnub.com/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_PubNub_lt_/a_gt_ where you don_t_t even have to touch backend stuff.

You upload your files and when the client navigated to the sub-domain those files are served.
