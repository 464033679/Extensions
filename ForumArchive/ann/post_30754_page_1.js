But unfortunately_co_ this will go with some breaking changes.. I am really not happy to integrate them but they are for the best and I will fully document them. Knowing our backward compatibility Philosophy in BJS_co_ I just want to give a long time ahead with our plan to ensure this will cause the lowest level of disruption on your projects. _lt_em_gt_Strikeout tasks have been completed._lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ol_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_s_gt_First thing_co_ is the migration of the current PBRMaterial in MaterialsLibrary under the name _lt_strong_gt_LegacyPBRMaterial _lt_/strong_gt_to ensure that the ones among you relying on it can continue to find the current version as of today. This will not be fully maintained but mainly keep for reference during the time everybody migrates to the newer/greater one.
