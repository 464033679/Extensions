There_t_re two main reasons_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ol_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\tThe text rendering quality is excellent_co_ no matter the size it_t_s displayed on the screen or its transformation (rotation_co_ being not coplanar with the viewport). Because the way the FontTexture_t_s character are generated make it now no more a bitmap representation of the character_co_ but what we call a Signed Distance Field one_dd_ we store the distance of a texel from the edge of the Font. Then we rely on the GPU texture_t_s interpolation unit to compute the most accurate value for the pixel to render and this way we have a great rendering fidelity.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tRight now_co_ if you _lt_strong_gt_don_t_t_lt_/strong_gt_ use SDF (Signed Distance Field for short)_co_ your text will be rendered in a _lt_strong_gt_transparent pass_lt_/strong_gt__co_ I cannot stress that enough_co_ because transparent rendering _lt_strong_gt_is by far the worst in term of cost_lt_/strong_gt__co_ I can_t_t use Instanced Array for everything (even if I_t_ve optimized to use them when the sorting of primitive_t_s part makes it possible)_co_ so it_t_s many draw calls_co_ and there_t_s of course alpha blending which is not the cheapest thing._lt_br /_gt_\n\t\tUsing SDF will render your text in _lt_strong_gt_Alpha Test_lt_/strong_gt_ rendering mode_co_ just think this mode as being like the opaque one_dd_ everything is rendered using Instanced Arrays_co_ the drawing order being not relevant_co_ so it_t_s freaking fast_dd_ all the text2D characters of all the primitives using the same font will be rendered in one draw call_dd_ you can_t_t do better than that!\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ol_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tOk_co_ there_t_re no silver bullet_co_ but SDF is close of being one_co_ right now the only inconvenient are that _dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ul_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\tit won_t_t look nice on text being rendered with one pixel wide_co_ like lucida console 10pt_co_ it_t_s not ugly_co_ but it_t_s not perfect either. If you switch to 12pt instead of 10 then the quality is immediately there.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tit takes time to compute the FontTexture because it relies on an algorithm to compute SDF_co_ it takes 80ms on my desktop and 160 on my mobile  phone to compute the ASCII map_co_ well_co_ you_t_re the judge but I think it_t_s fine.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ul_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tRight now I don_t_t support features such as Outlining or Shadow in FontTexture_co_ so it_t_s also not supported in SDF_co_ but soon I intend to do so and SDF will also be supporting

much as possible.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOne last thing_co_ the rendering quality is now using some kind of antialias_co_ it may be perfectible and also I don_t_t use the derivative functions of the fragment shader which could improve rendering quality when the text is not being co planar to the viewport_co_ I_t_ll see that in a second time.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHave fun experimenting

I made some mistakes and the price to pay to fix them will be _lt_strong_gt_breaking changes_lt_/strong_gt_. I know it sucks_co_ but it won_t_t be hard to refactor for you guys whenever you use spriteSize and the change is necessary. Before developing/committing the code_co_ I_t_d like to explain how these properties are working right now and how they will in the future _dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ul_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_spriteSize_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ currently it_t_s the size of the sprite displayed in the Canvas_dd_ that_t_s a mistake (more on this below)\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_spriteScaleFactor_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ a property created to balance the mistake of spriteSize (in a way)_co_ if you want your sprite to be displayed in the canvas with a size of (400_co_200) but the sprite_t_s bitmap is (200_co_100) then you have to set a spriteSize of (400_co_200) and a spriteScaleFactor of (0.5_co_0.5). This is lame because if you don_t_t know the real size of the sprite_t_s bitmap_co_ it_t_s difficult to get what you want.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_size_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ right now size is initialized from spriteSize during construction_co_ hence the behavior of spriteScaleFactor and this is also a mistake\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_scale_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ it_t_s something different from spriteScaleFactor right now but can be used to alter the size of the sprite on the canvas. To have both scale and spriteScaleFactor is currently a necessity_co_ but it_t_s due to bad design only.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ul_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tWell_co_ this is messy_co_ and it_t_s been a while I know it but couldn_t_t find the time to address this. Now that I_t_m working on the Scale9Sprite feature and next the TextureAtlas_co_ I_t_m willing to make things right for the sake of everybody as well as mine._lt_br /_gt_\n\tHere is how things are meant to be as of today _dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ul_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_spriteSize_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ will be the size of the sprite as it it _lt_strong_gt_in the texture_t_s bitmap_lt_/strong_gt_. if you don_t_t specify spriteSize_co_ then the whole texture will be used. It makes sense to use it this way_co_ it_t_s more coherent with spriteLocation which is also a setting express for the sprite_t_s texture bitmap.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_spriteScaleFactor_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ well_co_ this should be at least deprecated and certainly removed for the 2.6 RTM. Because you will rely on the following two properties to get the job done.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_size_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ it will be the size of the sprite _lt_strong_gt_as it is displayed in the canvas_lt_/strong_gt_. If you don_t_t specify it_co_ it will be the same as spriteSize. If you do_co_ then stretching/resizing will take place to achieve the size you want. If you don_t_t know spriteSize but wish to strech/resize_co_ then you will have to rely on the following property. Note that size if a property of Prim2DBase and all primitive actually use size with this behavior_co_ so it_t_s coherent with the other prims.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t_lt_strong_gt_scale_lt_/strong_gt__dd_ let you display in the Canvas a sprite bigger/smaller as it is in the texture using a scale factor. Same as above_co_ scale is a property of Prim2DBase and all prims use it this way.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ul_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tSo for me there are three main scenarios\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ol_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\tYou don_t_t know the size of the sprite_t_s bitmap_co_ then you deal with scale if you want to display it bigger/smaller\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tYou know the size of the sprite_t_s bitmap_co_ then you specify spriteSize and you can also specify Size to override how it must be rendered in the Canvas.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tYou rely on Texture Atlas_co_ then you know the spriteSize and spriteLocation of your sprite and there are many Sprite2D instances sharing the same babylon Texture_co_ it_t_s simple and there are no big changes between the Texture Atlas mode and the regular one.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ol_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tI don_t_t want things to be overkill but I_t_m wondering if I should introduce lockRatioW and lockRatioH properties to let you guys the possibility to keep the ratio between spriteSize and size by recomputing either the height or width whenever spriteSize and size doesn_t_t share the same ratio. Tell me if it_t_s useful or not_co_ I need feedback on this.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWell_co_ I also need feedback on all of this_co_ so please_co_ take a little time to think about it and tell me what you think_co_ anybody_t_s feedback is welcomed of course.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf I make such change_co_ then SpriteScale9 and TextureAtlas will be easier to code and especially easier for you guys to use and that_t_s the most important thing right now.
