This behavior can now be controlled using a new flag in the impostor options (part of the constructor.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThe behavior can be best seen in this simple playground_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#PRHF00_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//playground.babylonjs.com/#PRHF00_lt_/a_gt_ . The right sphere is a simple mesh and has no impostor. the left sphere has its parent set to the right sphere_co_ and the impostor is set with the ignoreParent flag. The right sphere_t_s position is still updated when the parent mesh is moving_co_ but it is also being controlled by the physics engine. Fun times!!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnother flag that I added has the amazing long name disableBidirectionalTransformation (a boolean).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis flag will disable the bidirection transofmration between the physics engine and babylon_co_ meaning - changing the mesh_t_s position in babylon will practically do nothing. The object will be controlled solely by the impostor. This is done to add a performance boost_co_ as the transformation step is being skipped. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am here for any questions! The playground is not fully updated_co_ so this feature will be there pretty soon.
