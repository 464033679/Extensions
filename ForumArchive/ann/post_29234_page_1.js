We try as much as possible to avoid breaking but sometimes it can help introducing a much better way to achieve something. This is the case for physics as now_co_ the physics impostor and its associated mesh are better linked. To better understand why_co_ extract from the doc_dd_ _qt__lt_span style_eq__qt_color_dd_#000000_sm__qt__gt__lt_em_gt_The physics impostor synchronizes the physics engine_t_s body and the connected object with each frame. That means that changing the object_t_s position or rotation in Babylon code will also move the impostor. The impostor is also the one updating the object_t_s position after the physics engine is finished calculating the next step_lt_/em_gt__qt_. In previous implementation_co_ we had a lot of users questions &amp_sm_ feedback that didn_t_t understand why moving the mesh wasn_t_t doing anything once it was transformed into a _qt_physic object_qt_. _lt_/span_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tPlease read our documentation to better understand how to use physics in Babylon.js_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/overviews/using_the_physics_engine_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//doc.babylonjs.com/overviews/using_the_physics_engine_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI_t_ve then updated my tutorial and the default sample of our main page_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t- Understanding collisions &amp_sm_ physics by building a cool WebGL Babylon.js demo with Oimo.js_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.davrous.com/2014/11/18/understanding-collisions-physics-by-building-a-cool-webgl-babylon-js-demo-with-oimo-js/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.davrous.com/2014/11/18/understanding-collisions-physics-by-building-a-cool-webgl-babylon-js-demo-with-oimo-js/_lt_/a_gt__lt_br /_gt_\n\t- Main sample_dd_ _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/Demos/Physics/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_http_dd_//www.babylonjs.com/Demos/Physics/_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDavid\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"ian","Date":"2017-04-02T12:25:18Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tDavrous.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIf we have model and box impostors (cubes) around model.
