It_t_s a 3D interactive story editor with game-shaped animations with hiding points to find or interactive objects to click to advance a story that you create_co_ which can happen successfully or with failure.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tYou will be able _dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ul_gt__lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Create multiple scenes and navigate from one to the other to make indoor scenes_co_ other outdoor ...\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Create multiple cameras per scene to create different viewpoints as can be seen in the movies and also navigate from one to the other. The cameras to create are cameras spectator_co_ there is also a camera made by default for the editor which is the user camera not use on the final rendering of the game.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Create a scene from scratch with a terrain and a user camera and a default spectator camera or create from a list of prefect scenes with different themes that you can complete and save to continue your work later.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Add primitive objects (to create hiding points to click) or customize for a scene_co_ position them_co_ turn them and scale them. Its objects can be interactive or not_co_ made visible or hidden and what does its interaction do following a type of click (single_co_ double_co_ drag and long) but also the camera change_co_ scene change_co_ triggering animations_co_ dialogues_co_ effects_co_ sounds or to make hidden objects visible ...\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Animate objects_co_ cameras and characters that are triggered with interactions on objects to advance the story.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- Each scene has default shadows to activate and a default sky rotation_co_ you can change the environment settings by changing the sky texture_co_ add fog and change post-process and others.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- You can also add backgrounds of different types to simulate a scene background. Ideal for creating depth quickly.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\t- You can also create lights_co_ the edit and exclude objects to illuminate.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ul_gt__lt_p_gt_\n\tSo you can create with MoviRender all kind of interactive story. This can be a police investigation to solve and according to the choices made_co_ the story runs successfully or with failure.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIt_t_s still under construction_co_ but it_t_s at a good enough scene to be able to talk about it. I do not know when I could finish it_co_ I still need maybe 2_co_ 3 months of work on it to release a first public version. I also have the whole site to do with tutorials. So I still have a lot of work.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI think it_t_s something that can be fun to create interactive stories.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tFeel free to leave your comments to get your opinion on this project. If you have ideas of what you would like to do with this kind of program_co_ it may inspire me to add what I would not think. I will make an announcement when this project is available.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you.
