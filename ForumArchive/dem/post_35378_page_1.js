sounds super easy.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tKnowing absolutely ZERO about how to get a physical object into a 3d model_co_ I asked a friend who has some gadgets if I could use his scanner.  Apparently it_t_s a good scanner for bigger objects like cars - we set the software to 1mm accuracy.  He said black and shiney objects didn_t_t scan well_co_ so I made a mixture of Isopropyl Alcohol and baby powder that I sprayed on the Gear VR.  What can I say it was a learning experience and I ended up with a controller that smells like a baby....  don_t_t try everything you read on the internet_co_ but I think that would work well on big objects that you don_t_t need to touch afterwards.  They had a special spray they used there too for scanning metal.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tAnyway_co_ here is the Gear VR 3d model scan output in a PG.  I scanned top + bottom separately_co_ so I just merged them approximately into a .obj file.  I thought I could wing it in Blender with ratios/dimensions_co_ but my skills are just not there (mostly for the trigger) and I will look for a different/better way!_lt_br /_gt_\n\t_lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#4XKSWJ_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_https_dd_//www.babylonjs-playground.com/#4XKSWJ_lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ unfortunately the results were_co_ for me_co_ mostly underwhelming_co_ if you look at the PG.  It was_co_ however_co_ a pretty fun thing to try out a scanner and see the results_co_ so at least it was a success in those terms.  I think fun factor really has to be considered _lt_img alt_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ data-emoticon_eq__qt__qt_ height_eq__qt_20_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png_qt_ srcset_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x_qt_ title_eq__qt__dd_)_qt_ width_eq__qt_20_qt_ /_gt_  First thing we had to do was calibrate the scanner by scanning a special plate.  It was like a strobe-light disco!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t _lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_120414.jpg.b46e30fb7fb8d3bcee0bb8008bad39a2.jpg_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16829_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16829_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_120414.thumb.jpg.5ae13fa4168a533288bc64010ea1c7ae.jpg_qt_ alt_eq__qt_20180126_120414.thumb.jpg.5ae13fa4168a533288bc64010ea1c7ae.jpg_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNext up_co_ here is a scan in progress (this is the Daydream controller not GearVR).  Those little circle stickers on the controller are used by the scanner and software as markers (like AR markers) for aligning/adding mesh vertices.  The blocky squares are light from the scanner itself.  The clear playing cards cases worked really well as a platform and did not show up in the scan.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_121653.jpg.d1ee671e8e203d18a3f2d4e12db74027.jpg_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16828_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16828_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_121653.thumb.jpg.102ab3a0452959aa9a924c09bdbb6007.jpg_qt_ alt_eq__qt_20180126_121653.thumb.jpg.102ab3a0452959aa9a924c09bdbb6007.jpg_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tSo_co_ that was a fun learning experience and probably a way NOT to do it!  There is another machine that I have access to that will build 3D models to within 1/10mm_co_ so human hair accuracy.  Here is a photo of that machine_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_a class_eq__qt_ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image_qt_ href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_130510.jpg.631fc3b4af19adda0984862d982f0060.jpg_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16830_qt_ rel_eq__qt__qt__gt__lt_img class_eq__qt_ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed_qt_ data-fileid_eq__qt_16830_qt_ src_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.html5gamedevs.com/uploads/monthly_2018_01/20180126_130510.thumb.jpg.210942358d28ddd2c1adefaa042d8477.jpg_qt_ alt_eq__qt_20180126_130510.thumb.jpg.210942358d28ddd2c1adefaa042d8477.jpg_qt_ /_gt__lt_/a_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThat machine above will generate planes of thousands of data points with high accuracy.  There is another machine downstairs from here that is 10x more accurate_co_ but I don_t_t imagine I will need that kind of accuracy as we need something low poly -
