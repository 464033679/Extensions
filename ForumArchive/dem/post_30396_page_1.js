This opens up the possibility that additional geometry can be retrieved_co_ but not actually loaded into the scene_co_ ahead of it being needed.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tOf course_co_ this is not really great if the textures are not also gotten in advance.  To solve this_co_ a small entry point in the generated .js file was added_co_ matReadAhead().  This method causes all the texture files to also be retrieved &amp_sm_ buffered in the VM async as well_co_ but no Texture Objects are created till needed.  When the .js arrives_co_ there is a very brief eval call on the user thread to touch this off.  Note_dd_  this works with compressed textures as well.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tIn this scene_co_ all the busts are retrieved dynamically.  The first of course_co_ delays when the scene becomes actually usable_co_ but all the remaining are downloaded after the first is taken care of.  Right now there are only 2_co_ but more are coming.  Also_co_ full size characters with armatures_co_ 30 face shapekeys_co_ &amp_sm_ 10 shapekeys on each hand are 5mb of geometry and up.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tBTW_co_ this all started_co_ because I wanted to do a bunch of scenes for this blog site_co_ but would get drowned if I had to make characters for every single scene.  I also did not want to have to statically link characters as this would be a maintenance issue as I add characters / busts.  Not to mention that it would slow down launch with each one added.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI normally do not do long reads_co_ sorry.  If you are still reading_co_ enjoy.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2017-05-13T02:44:15Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tReally great !\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Spankied","Date":"2017-05-21T00:55:40Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t_lt_p_gt_\n\tInteresting project.
