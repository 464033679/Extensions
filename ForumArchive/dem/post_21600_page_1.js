href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.punkoffice.com_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_www.punkoffice.com_lt_/a_gt_ .  My previous one was a complete 3D experience which I think put off potential clients with long loading times and non-intuitive navigation. This new one resembles a traditional website but with 3D elements in there.  No loading screens or progress bars.  Just a smooth transition.  A few tricky things here_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Placeholder images_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI didn_t_t want loading screens_co_ progress bars or blank spaces.  What I did was saved the canvas _qt_right click to save as an image_qt_ and displayed that behind a transparent canvas.  I used this code to hide that placeholder image as soon as the 3D object is displayed_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_pre_gt_\n_lt_code_gt_mesh.registerAfterRender(function() {\n\tif (start) {\n\t\t$(_qt_#placeholder_qt__co_ window.parent.document).hide()_sm_\n\t\tstart _eq_ false_sm_\n\t}\t\t\t\n})_sm__lt_/code_gt__lt_/pre_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is hiding the placeholder div in the iframes parent website. If webGL is not enabled and the 3D fails then the user still gets to see a 2D image.  Also search engines will parse the page and will use that placeholder image.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Title bar_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThis is in an iframe.  On desktop the light direction follows the mouse.  This is done using javascript _qt_postMessage_qt_ to send the mouse pointer position to the title bar in the iframe.  On mobile devices the title bar just moves with the compass.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Scrolling past iframes_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tMy web designer hated how the scroll wheel stops dead in its tracks when the cursor goes over an iframe.  I fixed this by listening to the mouse wheel event in the website within the iframe then passing the direction of the wheel to a function on the calling website then scrolling the appropriate amount.  Again only possible with iframes on same domain.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Working around broken sessions_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI needed sessions to authenticate the contact form_co_ making sure it was sent from the website not from someone typing directly in the URL.  For some reason as soon as a Babylon.js scene loads_co_ the standard PHP session is overwritten.  PHP sessions are stored via the cookie PHPSESSID.  All I did was use my own cookie and it remained untouched by scene loading.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t_lt_strong_gt_Babylon core_lt_/strong_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWhen I_t_m using Babylon.js iframes they can start to fail on mobile devices because of too many audio engines being created.  I switched to just using babylon.2.3.core.js and included the extras.  In this case I had to also include babylon.fxaaPostProcess.js for anti-aliasing the textures.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThank you Babylon.js community for all your help!!\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div
