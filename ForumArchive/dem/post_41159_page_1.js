In that vein_co_ we are in the middle of a complete rebranding effort for Babylon.js as a whole and the loading animation is obviously part of that work. We expect to launch it with the 4.0 release. That said_co_ I did want to take a chance to lay out what we are using as guidelines for motion and the UX design principles behind them. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_ul_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tWe need to have an indeterminate spinner for loading assets as we won_t_t be able to know how long the assets will take to load. The challenge with indeterminate spinners is that whenever you have a noticeable loop in the animation (as in the animation has a pause before starting over or the logo builds up to completion and then disappears to build again) the user will subconsciously notice the loop and count it. If they notice the number of loops taking longer than normal_co_ they will start building anxiety and likely click away. For an indeterminate spinner_co_ you want pleasing motion that is almost hypnotic so that the user gets lost in appreciation of the motion and does not notice the time passed as easily. This may seem strange and manipulative_co_ but most of UX design is about easing tensions and anxiety for the user to keep them engaged.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tWe would like to use the spinner as a branding moment_co_ but I am not convinced that means it needs to be the logo being manipulated. If you_t_ve noticed what Google has been doing with their branding moments in their various properties_co_ their spinners are all about the google branded colors as dots. You get the tie back to the brand because of the colors_co_ but they aren_t_t in the position to need to manipulate their logo to do it.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tMost brands do not allow additional elements being added to their logo. There are clear guidelines for standoff of additional elements and for the most part changing the treatment of the logo is regulated by the standards guidelines. This is to maintain recognition of the identity with consumers and build trust. It has been shown in many cases where simply changing the packaging of a product can cause a drop in sales as the consumer distrusts that this is the same product they_t_ve always purchased. In some ways_co_ brands have been beaten back into submission by consumers when they change their brand too much. A good example of this is when _lt_a href_eq__qt_https_dd_//www.marketing91.com/coca-cola-brand-failure/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Coca-Cola tried to use New Coke_lt_/a_gt_ as it_t_s new brand to compete with Pepsi in the 1980s. _lt_a href_eq__qt_http_dd_//www.trendingpackaging.com/innovative-packaging-design-of-coke-cans/_qt_ rel_eq__qt_external nofollow_qt__gt_Now what you see is a unification of branding_co_ even within subsets of offerings_lt_/a_gt_. Even with Diet Coke having a different name_co_ the logo is styled to feel like Coca-Cola to reinforce the overall brand.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n\t_lt_li_gt_\n\t\tWe have to design our motion around the limitations of CSS so that will be a forcing function for what the loading screen looks like. We want to reinforce the brand_co_ but at the same time adhere to good design principles and be easily recognizable. This is most important when people who may not be familiar with Babylon.js run across a site that uses us as a viewer. We want them to become aware of the engine even if they aren_t_t going to be building with it. It_t_s the same idea as the launch of a video game where you see all the logos of the middleware or engines on screen or the start of a movie where you see all of the logos of the production houses that worked on it.\n\t_lt_/li_gt_\n_lt_/ul_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHopefully this gives you some insight into what we are planning. We agree with you that the current motion isn_t_t a representation that we want to stick with and violates several of the points above.
