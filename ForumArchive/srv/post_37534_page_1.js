The latter implies these objects already exist_co_ in which case wouldn_t_t there already be CAD models in existence? The question is important because it will make a big impact on who you need to hire. If 3D CAD models exist then you essentially just need someone who can retopo / create a low-poly game-ready model from those CAD models. If only 2D CAD drawings exist you need someone who is proficient in modeling low-poly from supplied plans and elevations. If nothing yet exists and you_t_re working from ideas alone then you ideally need an industrial designer to work with you through all the design issues. Even if you just need conceptual models to illustrate an idea without the 100% accuracy required for prototype manufacture_co_ then there_t_s still a huge amount of time involved that_t_s not strictly modeling.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Rolento","Date":"2018-05-10T03:13:38Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi Dad72_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tRegarding the modelling project_co_ it would be paid work. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI posted this job here on the BabylonJS forum because I wanted to provide my support (where possible) to promote the website.  I did see a few other commercial jobs posted on the forum_co_ hence thought asking for assistance with 3D modelling here would be ok - if this type of request is deemed inappropriate I appologise and I will remove it.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWith respect to daily rate - I have no specific figure in mind.  At this time I just want to connect with modellers_co_ explain the project and then explore cost options. \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope that helps_co_ thanks.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Rolento","Date":"2018-05-10T03:27:56Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tHi Intega_co_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tThanks for your questions_co_ please see below for my response_dd_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tWith reference to_dd_ _lt_em_gt_I_t_m curious about _qt_illus_lt_span_gt_﻿_lt_/span_gt_trate a new concept_qt_ vs _qt_models need to be highly representative of their real-world counterpart_qt_._lt_/em_gt_\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am looking to create a design tool which enables equipment to be connected together to from assemblies.  The _qt_design tool_qt_ is the concept (i.e. a new conceptual design methodology)_co_ whereas the _qt_equipment_qt_ will be based upon real-world models.  So the 3D modelling requirement is to create models that are representative of real-world equipment (i.e. I will provide images of the real world equipment and I need a 3D modeller to create a representation of each part - it does not need to be an exact replica).\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI am not sure what the specific type of modeller is that I need (I suspect it is an industrial designer - as per your descriptions) - but effectively I just need someone who can create a 3D model based off 2D images that I provide.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tI hope that clears things up a little_co_ sorry for being a little vague.\n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n_lt_p_gt_\n\t \n_lt_/p_gt_\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t_lt_/div_gt_\n\n\t\t_lt_div class_eq__qt_ipsI_qt__gt__lt_/div_gt__lt_/div_gt_"},{"Owner":"Deltakosh","Date":"2018-05-10T15:23:49Z","Content":"_lt_div class_eq__qt_mages_qt__gt_\n\t\t\t\n_lt_p_gt_\n\tNo problem to post job offering!
